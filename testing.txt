you been doing with yourself all this long morning asked lady quickly glancing round the room for when she entered mrs was pacing up and down and her knitting lay deposited in its long basket a sure sign that the kind old lady labored under some unusual mental excitement i have been entertaining visitors for you â lord and lady the earl said with that beautiful smile of his that he could not drive away without shaking hands with me when he heard that i was at â no i am sure he would not what did you think of lady did she make herself agreeable â asked lady her bonnet â very t like her much better than i did what a pretty creature she is to be sure i her teeth are as pearls i thought to myself however they looked more like a pair of lovers than husband and wife she has such a strange way of glancing at him when his attention is attracted else were and then if by chance their eyes meet that beautiful color of hers â did leave any message for me â yes my dear she desired me to say she hoped you would return her visit very speedily she repeated this message twice i will go and see her to morrow that is if poor dear is in a condition to be left what do you mean is there anything amiss with sit down dear mrs and i will relate the scene i witnessed at this morning and then you will not think me perhaps the only unlucky person in the world and lady briefly what she had seen and heard good heavens what a dreadful affair exclaimed mr lifting up her hands â i am glad poor young creature she is coming here out of the reach of her ill natured mother s tongue love is a very different thing to what it used to be in my days then it made people happy now as far as my experience and observation go it produces quite an opposite effect poor i to think that he should get into this terrible mess as soon as he sets foot in england again i as a child he had always a fiery impetuous spirit poor fellow if anything happens to him will never forgive herself to her dying day how she ever could be mad enough to encourage that odious colonel i but here she comes said mrs interrupting herself as a loud peal from the hall door bell announced an arrival fly my dear and learn whether she has succeeded in her mission i declare the shocking catastrophe has made every limb in a minute however miss stood before them her face was still very pale and no smile of hope it she was followed closely by lady who alarmed at her agitated state had most kindly and insisted on accompanying her back to court lady s heart sank with apprehension when she heard the very brief tidings they were able to impart which amounted simply to the facts that lord called at the and after a short private interview with sir both gentlemen stepped into the carriage and ordered the to drive to all sir intimated to his mother was that an affair of importance would most probably detain him from home for a few days how far is from here asked about fifteen miles â you cannot do more dear yourself with the thought that will employ every resource to bring this unhappy affair to an termination said lady soothingly e s heart however refused to be thus consoled she wept as one without hope after lady s departure everything was said and done which the tenderest affection could suggest for lady appeared to forget her own in the sorrow of her friend during that long long afternoon wrote two letters one to her brother the other to colonel li them she exhausted every argument every entreaty the feeling could prompt she them to reflect ere they suffered a few hasty words to hurry them to the commission of a deed which if attended with fatal results would forever the existence of the her brother she passionately to pardon the injury done her by colonel even as she had forgiven it and not to poison her future life with the reflection that she had been his or else that of the man once dear enough to be accepted as her intended husband when these letters were despatched felt more she wandered on the terrace on the lawn in the as restless fancy suggested around were none but faces and she felt the consolation of the kind loving eyes bent upon her the evening came and wearied out with her long day of watching and excitement at length yielded to mrs s and suffered herself to be carried off to bed in triumph by the good old lady who after she had comfortably laid her patient s aching head on the pillow took a chair and stationed herself to watch beside her until she slept lady meanwhile remained passive in deep bought for some time after her friend and mrs quitted the room â now that was no longer present and the task of and comforting her friend ceased to divert her mind the full tide of her own anxieties overpowered her the day was drawing fast to its close and as the light glided stealthily from the apartment all around wore the gray solemn peculiar to an twilight lady sat with her elbow resting on the sofa cushion and her face buried in her hand heedless of the gathering gloom until the cold breeze caused her to raise her head half she arose with the intention of closing the windows when th sombre aspect of the room seemed all at once to strike her the thin muslin window curtains shook and waved in the wind which lightly drifted before ,7
and laughed at hood s and â read only laughed when we should have thought and sighed â we might have seen if we had sought instruction and not mere that a great teacher an earnest of tyranny and wrong a warrior with blade on cant and meanness and â was addressing us in which were only wasted as others have been because our ears were too gross our too dull and sordid to perceive or even seek their deeper meaning we might have discerned the lesson but did not because the laugh us have i seemed to regret or condemn the law whereby the true poet is from the hope of gain by his faculty i surely did not mean it wisely kindly devised is that divine ye cannot serve god and the law is steadfast and eternal â the seeming exceptions few and the greatest of mankind have waited till after death for the recognition of their work and their worth if to speak the highest truths and do the noblest deeds were the sure way to present fame and what merit would there be in virtue what place for heroism on earth if poetry were the avenue to fortune and present fame how could our earth the burden of her poets no it were better for poetry that there had never been a law so that the poet s were from all hope of pecuniary we should then have had far fewer poems perhaps but not half the trouble in them from the of rubbish whereby they are and concealed let youth understand that writing poetry is not among the appointed means for a of potatoes i do not say that potatoes were never gained in this way though i doubt that any were ever thus earned be this as it may i am quite sure that no one ever undertook to write poetry for potatoes â to satisfy per need of potatoes by writing poetry â who thereby truly succeeded he may have achieved the potatoes but not the so hood did and well in writing and for a and poetry for fame alone do you suppose the hope of money could ever have impelled any man to write the song of the shirt let us refresh our remembrance of him with the simplest and best known of his minor â one ten thousand times quoted familiar to almost every school child yet worn out because it cannot be â i i remember i remember i remember the house where i was bom the little window where the come peeping in at mom he never came a wink too soon brought too long n day but now i often wish the night had borne my breath away i remember i remember the roses red and white the and the lily cups â those flowers made of light the where the robin built and where my brother set the on his birthday â the tree is living yet i remember i remember where i was used to swing and thought the air must rush as fresh to on the wing my spirit flew in feathers then that is so now and summer pools could hardly the fever on my brow i i remember i remember the dark and high i used to think their slender tops were close a the sky it was a childish ignorance but now t is little joy to know i m farther off from heaven than when i was a boy poets and poetry how many years is it since he who is england s first dawned upon us it seems to me scarcely twenty yet he must have been writing and for nearly twice that period it is a slow as well as labor for even excellence to make itself felt across an ocean yet i believe there are to day as many americans as englishmen who honor and delight in the poems of alfred one of their best characteristics is the the evident labor and extreme polish with which they are produced after thirty years devoted to poetry â almost exclusively i believe â his writings may all be compressed within a moderate volume in an age when many a by no means old man has turned out his twenty volumes and many a miss in her has nearly finished her third novel this is a virtue indeed to be commended to one who has achieved the public ear â for whose future issues eager have of generous amount ready to be exchanged for the manuscript â the temptation to is hard to be resisted poets are supposed to be as a class neither rich nor the more honor then to one who refuses to his like a to whom the pump is convenient i was deeply interested in s anecdote of the german poet when in a green old age who to the traveller s natural inquiry as to what work he was now or meditating replied that he had not recently felt constrained to write anything â in other words that nothing now pressed upon his mind for utterance with irresistible force would that authors as a class could truly say that they write only under the spur of thoughts burning for expression â not of for satisfaction though has written he has yet covered much ground in the princess â i hardly know who in our day has produced three poems so unlike yet each so excellent in is probably the best expression of a profound and lasting yet temperate and sorrow to be found in our language yet his minor poems had made him a world wide reputation â made him the queen s â before one of these was written at least before it was published and they are worthy of their fame so rich and pure in so and in expression so musical and in their and â they are rightly among the gems ,8
estimation for she thought of and the fine tones of his well voice when he read to her in that little village in the and the moments flew so rapidly along t pictures op private life perhaps there are few things in which the cultivation or refinement of the intellectual powers is more perceptible than in the style of a person s reading for how well these readers may understand the meaning of the author it seems impossible tc give his words the proper tone and emphasis without a regular like training and when they read from a book precisely the same expressions which they make use of every day they seem bound to torture their words into a totally different sound merely because they are in print the books too which miller made choice were more ancient than the grandmother from whose library they had descended and then he would give long histories of that grandmother who had been a great personage in her day and figured as in the town of of the and what property the different branches of each family then possessed with accounts of houses that were pulled down tliat were built that were drained that were made and that were enclosed in his father s time and yet miller was a good man and ought not to have been despised for the number of good men is not so great as to make them worthless yes he was indeed a good man for he endeavoured to keep the service of his maker continually before

fidelity and zeal if be made an idol of any thing it was his wife and well he for she was a good and kind one and he was proud and happy in the possession of such a treasure but her sickly friend he could not understand nor why she was not as cheerful as himself and mary so he fixed upon the absence of religion as the cause and perhaps he was not so far wrong as in the means he adopted to remedy the evil for he read the bible to her till she was weary of hearing it and good books in such numbers tliat she forgot both their nature and their names and all the while her wandering spirit would fly to happier and clearer skies leaving the dull realities of life behind the first coming of spring is peculiarly delightful to those whose minds are at who feel the importance and the of entering upon another year of duty and enjoyment and can look up to their creator with that he has given them a taste to enjoy the one and a reasonable hope of being able to perform the other the first pale snow drop that burst from its icy prison mary gathered and presented to her friend and the first lamb that brought in she would have given her too thinking it might amuse and interest her but s heart was far away from the simple pleasures of the cottage and she cared for none of these things when the first song of the lark was heard one bright sabbath morning as they walked to church mary looked up to the skies and inwardly blessed the god of nature who had placed her in a world so beautiful and happy while bent her eyes upon the earth and wished that httle bird w ringing over her grave and yet she had the reliance upon the and fidelity of her lover but for all that she was not happy she believed too that he would come again and find her even in her obscurity and yet she was not happy all around her was contentment and peace and yet she was not happy ah that we could always compel ourselves to a strict impartial and thorough investigation into the causes of our that we would make an which admits of no why we are not as the merciful author of our doing designed we should be our blessings and counting the which his gracious hand upon us would not such an generally produce the conviction that we are not giving up the whole heart to him who has an right to rule over it that we are making f the hall and the cottage i no better than a that if he will us some particular request

the simple and earnest prayer of mary every before she retired to rest while became a stranger to the duty of prayer altogether for the present she knew of no blessings at least she felt none for which to be thankful and lor the future she had but one overpowering and if that should be denied she believed it so utterly impossible to be resigned that she never even help from til at being to

looked upon by me as sacred de the golden book of spirit and sense has called it i have always looked upon as a sacred book from the very beginning of my life it me of the belief that man has a lower nature and i learned from it that the spirit and the flesh are equal that earth is as beautiful as heaven and that perfection of form is virtue de was a great influence a water dashed by a sacred hand and the words are forever ringing in my ear by exaltation of the spirit and the flesh thou shalt live this book would be regarded by pro my correspondent as he regards my and its publication has been in england how it be permitted to in a country in which the kingdom of heaven is in theory regarded as more important than the kingdom of earth a few pages back the idea came up under my pen that the aim of practical morality was to render love as as possible and i suppose though he has never thought the matter out the christian would regard as the most of writers for his theme is always praise of the visible of all that we can touch and see and in this book art and sex are not i have often wondered if the of the twain so noticeable in english literature is not the origin of this strange belief that bodily love is part of our lower nature our appreciation of the flush dying in the west has been heightened by descriptions seen in pictures and read in poems and i cannot but think that if the lover s exaltation before the curve of his mistress s breast had not been forbidden the ugly thought that the lover s is inferior to the poet s would never have obtained there is but one energy and the vital whether expended in love or in a poem is the same the poet and the lover are they and carry on the great work begun of years ago when the great breath breathing out of chaos the stars into being but why do i address myself like this to the average how little will he understand me in the adventure which him there was an appreciation of beauty which he has i am afraid rendered himself incapable of myself and were spiritual by the adventure s rendering of the moonlight till she went to was merely brilliant and effect of my dead life ive and have not all the critics in england agreed that the story in which i relate her contains some of the best pages of prose i have written but why talk of myself when there is s experience to speak about did he not write to madame i owe you for all eternity she has not left any written record of her debt to perhaps because she could not â nd words to give the reader any idea how great it was histories of human civilization there are in abundance but i do not know of any history of the human intelligence but when this comes to be written â if it ever should come to be written â the writer will hesitate at least i can imagine him hesitating how much of the genius of artists he would be justified in tracing back to impulses as my correspondent me looked upon love of woman as a means of increasing his and my correspondent seems to think that he did them wrong thereby whereas i think he honored them exceedingly held the contrary belief so us maintaining that great spiritual could be gained by restraint and when inquiry was made into his precise on this point he confessed that he could not allow an author more than half an hour once a year with his beloved he placed no however on correspondence for that helped to form a style when mentioned the names of certain great men whose lives offered a striking of this theory answered they would have written better if they had lived seems to have left the question there and so will we remarking only that was prone to laws out of his single experience i remember having written or having heard somebody say in other writers we discover this or that xxii pro things but everything exists in and in his conversation with we do not find him as a virtue but the results that may be gotten from as a might it is said that english in india sometimes drive out in their pony to visit a holy man who has left his plentiful food and a luxurious dwelling for a cave in some lonely the pony chaise only takes the parson to the mouth of the and leaving his wife and children in charge of his servant the parson the rocky way on foot meeting perchance a fat peasant priest from bent on the same mission as himself â the of the it is amusing for a moment to imagine these two western sitting with the saint on the ledge in front of the cave thinking to win his sympathy they tell him that on one point they are all agreed the s eyes would how can this thing be his eyes would seem to ask and it is easy to imagine how contemptuously he would raise his eyes when he gathered gradually from their discourse that his visitors believed that was incumbent upon all men but all men are not the same he would answer if he answered his visitors i dwell in solitude and in silence and am and live upon the rice that the pious leave on the rocks for me but i do not regard and as possessed of any inherent merits as virtues they are but a means to an end how would you impose upon all men since every man brings a different idea into ,3

took care to have the loan repaid a few years afterwards by a part of the first gold brought by from the new world in the of tlie royal saloon in the d palace of the or ancient abode of the kings the

the noble of that princess i chapter viii arrangement with the spanish on at fe had an of the and the she received him for all past neglect her favourable countenance every cloud of doubt and difficulty the of the king was readily obtained his objections bad been removed by tbe of persons among whom is particularly mentioned his grand and favourite but it was principally through deference to the seal displayed by the queen that be yielded hit was the soul of this grand she was prompted by and generous enthusiasm while the king remained cold and calculating in this as in all his other ae great objects held out by in his undertaking was the of the christian faith he expected to arrive at tbe extremity of asia at the vast and magnificent empire of die grand and to visit the dependent islands of which he had read such extravagant accounts in the writings of in describing these and semi barbarous regions he had reminded their of the inclination manifested in former times by the grand to embrace the christian faith and of the which had been sent by and pious sovereigns to ib f life and voyages of instruct him and his subjects in catholic doctrines he now considered himself about to effect this great work he contemplated that by means of his discovery an intercourse might be opened with this immense empire that the whole might speedily be brought into to the church and thus as had been foretold in holy writ the light of revelation might be extended to the remotest ends of the earth listened to this suggestion with complacency he made his religion to his interests and had found on the recent conquest of that extending the sway of the church might be made a means of extending his own according to the doctrines of the day every nation that refused to acknowledge the truths of christianity was fair spoil for a christian and it is probable that was more stimulated by the accounts given by of the wealth of and other provinces belonging to the grand than by any anxiety for the of him and his semi barbarous subjects had nobler she was filled with pious zeal at the idea of such a great work of salvation from different motives therefore both of the sovereigns accorded with tlie views of in this particular and when he afterwards departed on his voyage letters were actually given him for the grand of the ardent enthusiasm of did not stop here in the free and communications which were now permitted him with the sovereigns his visionary spirit kindled up with his of the boundless wealth that was to be realized by his discoveries and he suggested that the treasures thus acquired should be consecrated to the pious purpose of the holy of from the power of the the sovereigns smiled at this sally of tbe imagination but expressed well pleased with it and assured him that without the funds he anticipated they should be weu disposed to that holy taking what the king and however may have considered a mere of momentary excitement was a deep and cherished design of it is a and fact which has never been particularly that the recovery of the holy was one of the great objects of his ambition meditated throughout the remainder of his life and solemnly provided for in bis will in fact he considered it as one of tbe great works for which he was chosen by heaven as an agent and he afterwards looked upon bis great discovery as but a preparatory of providence to its accomplishment a perfect understanding being thus effected with the sovereigns ce of an arrangement were ordered to he drawn out by de the royal secretary they were to tbe following

that he was a great the cunning while he pretended to be struck dumb outright with the of the great von took silent note of the of his garrison of which he gave a an afternoon s campaign hint to his followers who tipped each other the wink and laughed most â in their sleeves the inspection review and being concluded the party to the table for his other great qualities the general was to huge or and in one afternoon s campaign leave more dead men on the field than he ver did in the whole course of his military of these do still on record and the whole province was â thrown in by the return of one of his wherein it was stated that though ike captain he had only twenty men to him yet in the short space of six months he conquered and utterly sixty oxen one hundred sheep ten thousand one thousand of potatoes one and fifty of small beer two seven hundred and thirty five pipes eight pounds of sugar forty â of iron besides sundry small game and garden stuff â an achievement since the days of and his army and which showed that it was necessary to let potent von his garrison loose in an enemy s country and n a little while they would breed a famine and all the inhabitants no sooner therefore had the general received a a s von s banquet the first intimation of the visit of governor than he ordered a great dinner to be prepared and privately sent out a of his most experienced to rob all the in the neighbourhood and lay the under contribution â b service to which they had been long and which they discharged with such incredible zeal and that the garrison table groaned under the weight of their spoils i wish with all my heart my readers could see the von as he presided at the head of it was a sight worth beholding â there he sat in his greatest glory surrounded by his soldiers like that famous wine alexander whose thirsty virtues he did most imitate â telling stories of his adventures and heroic exploits at which though all his knew them to be most and outrageous yet did they cast up their eyes in admiration and utter many of astonishment nor could the general pronounce any thing that bore the remotest semblance to a joke but the stout would strike his fist upon the table till every glass rattled again throwing himself back in the chair and uttering gigantic of laughter swearing most horribly it was the best joke he ever heard in his life â thus all was and and hideous within fort and so did von the bottle capture of fort that in less than four short hours he made himself and his whole garrison who all the deeds of their dead drunk and singing songs and drinking patriotic none of which but was as long as a or a plea in no sooner did things come to this pass than the and his who had kept themselves sober rose on their tied them neck and heels and took formal possession of the fort and all its depend in the name of queen of at the same time an oath of to all the dutch soldiers who could be made sober enough to swallow it then put the in order appointed his discreet and friend a tall water drinking to the command and departed bearing with him this truly amiable garrison and their commander who when brought to himself by a sound bore no little resemblance to a fish or sea monster caught upon dry land the of the garrison was done to prevent the of intelligence to new for as much as the cunning in his he dreaded the vengeance of the sturdy peter whose name spread as much terror in the neighbourhood as did that of the among his enemies the feminine qualities of fame chapter ii profound secrets are often brought to light the proceedings of peter the he heard of the mis of general von whoever first described common fame or rumour as belonging to the sex was a very owl for she has in truth certain feminine qualities to an astonishing degree particularly that benevolent anxiety to take care of the affairs of others which keeps her continually hunting after secrets and about them whatever is done openly and in the face of the world she takes but transient notice of but whenever a transaction is done in a corner and attempted to be in mystery then her goddess ship is at her wit s end to find it out and takes a most mischievous and lady like pleasure in it to the world it is this truly feminine that her continually to be into of princes listening at the key holes of chambers and peering through and when our worthy are sitting with closed doors between a dozen excellent modes of the nation it is this which makes her so to all wary and history of â such a stumbling block to private and secret which she often by means and instruments which never would have been thought of by any but a female head thus it was in the case of the affair of fort no doubt the cunning imagined that by securing the garrison he should for a long time prevent the history of its fate from reaching the ears of the gallant but his was blown to the world when he least expected it and by one of the last beings he would ever have suspected of as to the deity this was one or a kind of on to the garrison who seemed to belong to nobody and in a manner to be self he was one of those vagabond who about the world as if they had no right or business in ,6

made a very respectable appearance in his dark grey coat to be sure he had not a very good for honesty and was suspected of sometimes stealing a portion of the grain which was given him to grind but perhaps some are quite as as this small as grew older it was found that he had far more important matters in his mind than the manufacture of toys like the little all day if left to himself he was either absorbed in thought or engaged in some book of by ic stories or natural philosophy at night i think it probable he looked up with curiosity to the stars and wondered they were worlds like our own â and how great was their distance from the earth â and what was the power that kept them in their courses perhaps even so early in life felt a that he should be able hereafter to answer all these questions when was fourteen years old his mother s second husband being now dead she wished her son to leave school and assist her in managing the farm at for a year or two therefore he tried to turn his attention to farming but his mind was so bent on becoming a scholar that his mother sent him back to school and afterwards to the university of cambridge i have now finished my anecdotes of s boyhood my story would be far too long were i to mention all the splendid â which he made after he came to be a man he was the first that found out the nature of light for before his day nobody could tell what the sunshine was composed of yoa remember i suppose the story of an apple s falling on his head and thus leading him to discover the force of which keeps the heavenly bodies in their courses when he had once got hold of this idea he never permitted his by ic mind to rest until he had searched out all the laws by which the are guided through the sky this he did as thoroughly as if he had gone up among the stars and them in their the boy had found out the of a the man explained to his fellow men the of the universe while making these he was accustomed to spend night after night in a lofty tower gazing at the heavenly bodies through a his mind was lifted far above the things of this world he may be said indeed to have spent the greater part of his life in worlds that lie thousands and millions of miles away for where the thoughts and the heart are there is our true existence did you never hear the story of and his little dog diamond one day when he was fifty years old and had been hard at work more than twenty years studying the theory of light he went out of his chamber leaving his little dog asleep before the fire on the table lay a heap of manuscript papers containing all the discoveries which had made during those twenty years when his master was gone up rose little diamond jumped upon the table and the lighted candle the papers immediately caught fire just as the destruction was completed opened the chamber door and perceived that the by ic labors of twenty years were reduced to a heap of ashes there stood little diamond the author of all the mischief almost any other man would have the dog to immediate death but patted him on the head with his usual kindness although grief was at his heart oh diamond diamond exclaimed he thou little the mischief thou hast done this incident affected his health and spirits for some time afterwards but from his conduct towards the little dog you may judge what was the sweetness of his temper lived to be a very old man and acquired great renown and was made a member of parliament and received the honor of from the king but he cared little for earthly fame and honors and felt no pride in the of his knowledge all that he had learned only made him feel how little he knew in comparison to what remained to be known i seem to myself like a child observed he playing on the sea shore and picking up here and there a curious shell or a pretty while the boundless ocean of truth lies before me at last in when he was and five years old sir died â or rather he ceased to live on earth we may be permitted to believe that he is still searching out by ic stories the infinite wisdom and goodness of the creator as earnestly and with even more success while his spirit animated a mortal body he has left a fame behind him which will be as as if his name were written in letters of light formed by the stars upon the midnight sky i love to hear about mechanical â such as the water clock and the little remarked george i suppose if sir had only thought of it he might have found out the steam engine and all the other famous inventions that have come into use since his day very possibly he might replied mr temple and no doubt a great many people would think it more useful to manufacture steam engines than to search out the system of the universe other great besides have been endowed with mechanical genius there was david an american â he made a perfect little water mill when he was only seven or eight years old but this sort of ingenuity is but a mere in comparison with the other talents of such men it must

frequent delivery of the vo london from the review t he motion of the honourable member for the county of which this speech introduced relates to a most important branch of that reform which is so loudly called for in the administration of our criminal the great obstacle which continually presents itself to any attempts to introduce and a better discipline within our is the crowded state of the from the return made by order of the house of it appears that eighty five which are stated as capable of containing only prisoners had in them at one vol i western s speech by the th of the king the number of classes or pointed out to be essentially necessary amount to eleven in number and even these are not sufficient to keep of different descriptions properly separated from each other and to prevent the fatal mischief of the young with the hardy and now out of three hundred and ty eight of all descriptions it appeared that seventeen only were or divided according to law ninety had only two divisions merely to separate from females eight had only three fifty one four nineteen five and so on â the same gives directions for materials to be found and prisoners set to work but in two hundred and seventy four of the no work at all was done in sixty four some work was done and in few of these sixty four a considerable deal had been accomplished now mr western showed that if there was but another jail delivery some time in january it would to very nearly one the total number of prisoners for whom it is now necessary to provide room in the and to maintain so many months longer the following facts appeared from the papers laid before the house of at the last out of prisoners for trial were in prison before the st of october last and before the st of january a jail delivery in january therefore would have reduced the number for trial from to at the last lent at the total number tried was of whom were in prison before the st of october of these eleven were six of them being discharged by two were in prison eight months three seven months and eight days three six months and eighteen days whilst on the other hand sixteen convicted of were considered to be sufficiently punished by imprisonment under six months mr western upon the injustice of this long before trial so contrary to the spirit and even the letter of our law than one third of the prisoners tried are in general of the twenty nine tried at who had lain in prison since the first of october seven were nine of them by having no bill found against them or not at the same time twenty five convicted were to the longest period of confinement being six months nothing is more common than for the court to address the prisoner and tell him that in consideration of the time he had lain in prison his sentence was a further imprisonment for one month only two men thus brought to the bar who had each been in prison five months â the one convicted is told that his sentence is one natural bridge s month imprisonment only in consequence of five already suffered the other is put up afterwards and a jury of his country return a verdict of not guilty yet has he endured of the punishment of the one who was convicted there were three at who after being above seven months in prison were discharged by upon the whole it appears that of those persons who were tried at the last had been in jail before the of october whilst persons convicted of suffered under their sentence a lighter punishment than the had experienced before trial it is impossible for eloquence to add to the force of these facts and indeed nothing can be more than the tone in which mr western argued in support of the motion he brought forward it must we think be adapted to impress a foreigner with a high idea of the british house of to notice the calm business like way in which the most important measures are and to contrast with the and set speeches of foreign such sober unaffected as this speech of mr

i should be jealous the last thing on earth i should think of for between ourselves sir is now so much engaged with public affairs that he cares no more for beauty than i do for business indeed said with well acted astonishment there was a looking in that painting room ask not why placed in the best possible situation and in this mirror were at this time reflected the figures of the two ladies in clear and striking contrast the temptation was irresistible one glance was ail that ventured but that glance was to bring the glow of womanly triumph into her the beauty which she would not at this moment have exchanged for a for lady was a little hard woman with dull grey eyes and a complexion with which all the colours of the rainbow either singly or must the different reflections which the mirror had excited followed each other much more rapidly than they could possibly be described and all the while the eloquent lady went on did you ever see sir he is i assure you the best subject in the world for a picture his hair is not so dark as yours why bless me her eyes to their utmost width you are exactly like a picture i found soon after we married hid behind a trunk i did not observe it while you looked so pale but now it s very odd i never saw a greater likeness in my life i remember asking sir about that picture and he told me some story about its being painted by an italian artist i should like to see it said with well affected curiosity as soon as she had recovered her self possession â you shall if i can find it but that is hardly probable for i believe it was put pictures op private life away in one of those haunted rooms at the top of the house where no one dares to go alone but go myself and send it to you it certainly has more colour than you have now and looks â i will not say younger but happier however you shall see it yourself and so saying the busy lady wished them a good morning and hurried home a good natured little woman said as soon as she and mary were to themselves sir had a fine taste for beauty hush hush take care what you say nay i would not for the world say any thing against this good lady who seems so graciously disposed towards her humble servant but did you ever see any thing like her choice of colours â a bright nay do not look so grave mary i will not say another word if i you but do you know i have been to paint a portrait sir impossible i yes i assure you it was so and now mary what do you say shall i dress myself all in a green mantel as ladies do in story books and hie me to sir s and to his lady s bower and the great and small which is the fairer flower i think can trust you trust me mary you may indeed trust me for all the wealth this lady possesses and her rank if she could it upon me would not place

saying she laid the picture on the fire and was quietly watching the smoke and flames curl over it in fantastic wreaths when suddenly that it might be for she folded it again in its cover and never

said to herself but because he had been treated so and suffered so and she had done it all and she used to introduce many new into her prayers in which if there was not any name expressed she felt that it would be understood and the blessings would reach him just the same the summer had gone and the indian summer had come in its place dreamy and sad it always made her melancholy and this year although the weather was perfect she was affected she said by the heat and did not go out of doors much so presently her cheeks were not as blooming as they had been and even her great eyes lost some of their lustre at least charity thought so and said so too not only to but to her master whom she scared half to death and who notwithstanding that dr was coming every other day to see a patient on the plantation and that the next day was the time for his regular visit put a boy on a horse that night and sent him with a note urging the doctor to come the next morning to breakfast the doctor came and spent the day examined s lungs and heart prescribed out door exercise and left something less than a of for her to take was at the time of his visit in a very excited state for the colonel had with a view of soothing her the night before delivered a violent against marriage in general and in particular against marriage with impudent young who did not know their places and he had proposed an extensive tour embracing all the united states and canada and intended to cover the entire winter and spring following who had stood as much as she could stand finally and had with flashing eyes and cheeks bob s cause with a courage and dash which had almost the old colonel not that he was anything to her in virginia except a friend she was most careful to explain but she was tired of hearing her friend assailed and she thought that it was the highest compliment a man could pay a woman etc etc or all of which she did a great deal of blushing in her own room afterward thus it happened that she was both excited and penitent the next day and thinking to make some and at the same time to make the prescribed exercise which would excuse her from taking the she filled a little basket with to take old aunt at the far quarters and thus it happened that as she was coming back along the path that ran down the meadow on the other side of the creek which was the dividing line between the two and was almost at the foot bridge that somebody had made for her so carefully with logs cut out of his own woods and the long shadows of the made it gloomy and everything was so still that she had grown very lonely and unhappy â thus it happened that just as she was thinking how kind he had been about making the bridge and hand rail so strong and about everything and how cruel he must think her and how she would never see him any more as she used to do she turned the of to step up on the log and there he was standing on the bridge just before her looking down into her eyes she tried to get by him â she remembered that after ward â but he was so mean it was always a little confused in her memory and she could never recall exactly how it was she was sure however that it was because he was so pale that she said it and that she did not begin to cry until afterward and that it was because he would not listen to her explanation and that she didn t let him do it she could not help it and she did not know her head was on his shoulder anyhow when she got home that evening her improvement was so apparent that the colonel called charity in to note it and declared that virginia country doctors were the finest in the world and that was the greatest doctor in the state the change was wonderful indeed and the old gilt mirror with its covered frame would never have known for the sad eyed of the day before the bright happy little maiden that stood before it now and smiled at the beaming face which at its own content old s was a protracted and the good things carried her daily did not tend to the sickness ever afterward she blessed the lord for whenever s name was mentioned had she known how sympathetic bob was during this period she would doubtless have included him in her but although he was that bridge every afternoon regularly notwithstanding s oft wish and express orders as regularly declared no one knew a word of all this and it was virginia a bow drawn at a venture when on the evening that had tried to carry out her engagement to bring her uncle around the old man said why the young rascal s cause seems to be she was so confident of her success that she was not prepared for failure and it struck her like a fresh blow and though she did not cry until she got into her own room when she got there she threw herself on the bed and cried herself to sleep it was so cruel in him she said to herself to desire me never to speak to him again and oh if he should really catch him on the place and shoot him the in our language were probably invented by young women the headache had the next morning was not invented poor little thing her last hope was gone she determined ,1

appears at a later time in s relation a tract that bears abundant internal evidence of the writer s mental inability to speak the truth himself relates that the indians were already hostile to west s party and that they had wounded and killed some of west s men in resentment of their wanton see also the account in the oxford tract with the james river experiments i natures of pots and for smith s version of the affair bloody seems not to have been a trait of smith but the was a terrible one for death by starvation was already impending and only the restoration of discipline at any cost could have saved the colony from the horrible fate it met such a course would not have done much violence to the notions of the time and would have found in the various plots against the lives of smith and others in the colony it is quite probable however that there is no truth in the story the violent hatred of the will account for the suspicion captain smith s true relation was sent from virginia and was printed in london in in he published what is commonly referred to as the oxford tract its proper title is very long the first part of it is as follows map of virginia with a description of the the people government and religion written by captain sometime governor of the and is the proceedings of those colonies since their first departure from england etc the second part of the book to be taken from the writings of eight of the whose names are given and to have been by w s â that is the reverend dr a history of virginia was first proposed in a speech by mr smith at a meeting of the virginia company april this seems to have been not captain smith but john smith of he suggested the writing of a history to preserve the memory of the of virginia dead and living and gave it as his opinion that no spanish settlement of the same age afforded matter more interesting which worthy speech says the record had of the whole court a very great applause as spoken freely to a purpose and therefore thought to be considered and put in practice in his due time and for which also mr as preferring of consequence was exceedingly commended ms records of the virginia company i we have no means of knowing whether or not this suggestion had any relation to the production of captain john smith s the first edition of which appeared in the last two in the book is a of smith s earlier works somewhat expanded not to say the later portions are mostly made up from the official and o just what was dr s part in the preparation of the oxford tract i chap ii note rise of the first colony book i and the historic it would be interesting to know its descriptive portions are of high value and we are now able to control its historical errors to a certain extent besides these three works on virginia smith published a description of new england new england s trials and for the of new england or elsewhere in the year of his death these all contain valuable matter relating to virginia he also published in two works on a sea grammar and the or pathway to experience necessary for a young seaman in he published his true travels a book which contains an account of his own adventures previous to his going to virginia more than a quarter of a century had elapsed between the occurrence of these adventures and their publication smith s vivid imagination had meantime no doubt greatly his own exploits it is quite impossible at this day to what truth there is in the true travels from the in that time were not held to a very rigid account and their first obligation seems to have been to amuse their readers no distinct line had yet been drawn in literature between fact and fiction many years ago before i had had an opportunity to examine and compare all his writings i printed a brief argument in favor of the of captain john smith and the of the story i believe no person of critical judgment can make a thorough comparison of smith s successive books without being convinced of the tendency of his mind to romance in adventure especially his own adventure even his style where his vanity speaks loses something of its native and force his practical writings on and on the proper conduct of and his descriptions of the country and the savages are plain direct and his personal morals were probably one of his associates to his freedom from tobacco debts and oaths but a comparison between the statements made in the oxford tract and those in the historic leaves upon the mind of the critic a distinct impression of the very processes by which his adventures were exaggerated in his own memory as time elapsed the three or four hundred savages on the oxford tract p a sufficiently story rise to three or four thousand in the historic becomes the central figure in incidents as told in ill which she had no place in there is but one james river experiments to in the entire oxford tract p and that has to do with the charge that smith intended to marry her a just and witty judgment of captain smith was made almost in his own time by thomas fuller he says such his perils dangers they seem to most men beyond belief to some beyond truth yet we have two witnesses to them the prose and the pictures both in his own book and it much to the of his deeds that he alone is the herald to publish and proclaim them however moderate men must allow captain smith to have ,14
principle of yielding what is due from a wife to a husband make a clear distinction that and what would be expected by a tyrant from his slave who make themselves cheerful and comfortable with what it is proper for them to enjoy neither what they ought to give up nor giving up what they cannot afford to lose such women are upon the whole to be preferred as companions and certainly they are themselves from a world of wounded feeling under which the more generous are perpetually suffering and at the same time weeping and that they do so there is however a most delicate medium in these cases to be observed for when once woman loses the disinterested generosity of her character she loses her greatest charm and when she becomes a for rights or a of good things upon her greater as being a more delicate and fragile being than man she may indeed be said to have all that claims for her sex our interest and our admiration but on the other hand though she may not be aware of it there is a secret and deep seated selfishness in the wounded â feeling which a generous act on finding it not valued according to its cost would it not then be wise to let this be our that none should give up more than they are prepared to resign without whether noticed and appreciated or not in my remarks upon the subject of i would of course be understood to refer only to those trifling and familiar affairs in which the personal comfort of daily life is concerned the higher and more sacred claims of trial and calamity with which the experience of every human being is occasionally admit neither of doubt calculation nor delay here i cannot suppose it possible that a true hearted woman would feel the least reserve for here it sacred privilege to forget herself to count no item of her loss to weigh no difficulty and to shrink from no pain provided she can suffer for or even with the companion whose existence is bound up with hers whatever doubt may be entertained on the subject of making self and selfish gratification to a husband s tastes and in all the little of domestic arrangement there can be none with regard to what is right m mixing in society either with friends or strangers it is here the privilege of a married woman to be able to show by the most delicate attentions how much she feels her husband s superiority to not by mere personal services rendered as if for the purpose of display but by a respectful reference to his opinion a willingly imposed silence when he speaks and if he be an enlightened man by a judicious turn sometimes given to the conversation so that his information and intelligence may be drawn forth for the benefit of others it is true that a considerable portion of tact is required to manage such matters as these without appearing to manage them at all for if the husband is once made to suspect that his wife is upon him for the purpose of showing how good a wife she is his situation will scarcely be more agreeable than that of the man who is made a mere of in company and called hither and thither to do little personal services for his wife as if she had mistaken him for one of her servants or what is more likely had chosen this means of exhibiting her unbounded influence over him both these extremes are at with good taste to say nothing of right feeling and here as in innumerable instances besides we see that if the tact i have so highly recommended in a previous work be valuable before marriage it is infinitely more so afterwards indeed there is scarcely one among the various of female character not even the highest accomplishments exhibited by the most distinguished which may not in some way or other be rendered a still more exquisite to married life provided only it is kept in its proper place and made always to that which is more thus the most fastidious taste when employed in selecting what is agreeable to a husband s fancy becomes to its possessor while those accomplishments which in the crowded drawing room were worse than useless in their display may sometimes be accounted as actual wealth to her who has the good feeling to render them to the amusement or the happiness of her own fireside on the other hand it is painful to hear the complaint so frequently made by married men that their wives have ceased to touch the instrument whose keys were rendered so sweetly available in the great object of charming before marriage and did not kindness or delicacy forbid a further disclosure of the secrets of their lot there is doubtless a greater number who could speak of their regret that the air of careful neatness the becoming dress and the general of look and manner which first won their attention had been gradually laid aside as advancing years and increasing cares had rendered them more necessary as an additional charm to the familiar scenes of domestic life yet in spite of appearances it is scarcely possible to imagine how there should be in any other situation so natural and so delightful a display of personal attractions as at home and before the one being whom of all the world we love best especially when we reflect that his destiny being bound up with ours if we allow him to feel weary of our company annoyed by our or dissatisfied with our personal appearance he must at the same time suffer doubly from the conviction that these things are to remain the

in its flight when the shot was fired but it had strength enough to reach castle island it then over falling dead on the shore and i ask you if it is that i should have been impressed such a thing was never heard of before â a wild bird with its legs tied together at first i believed that this bird was sent to warn me from but it was that bird that put the idea into my head how i might escape from the parish without giving scandal life is so strange that one doesn t know what to think of what use are signs and if the interpretation is always obscure they merely the will out of us and well we may ask who would care for his life if he knew he was going to lose it on the morrow and what mother would love her children if she were certain they would fall into evil ways or if she believed the who told her that her children would oppose her ideas she might lore them independent of their opposition but how could she love them if she knew thej were only bom to do wrong volumes have been written on the subject of and f and the truth is that it is as impossible to believe in one as in the other nevertheless have a of coming true and if i am crossing the lake you will be convinced of the truth of perhaps i should not write you these things but the truth is i cannot help myself there is no power of resistance in me i do not know if i am well or ill my brain is on fire and i go on thinking and trying to arrive at some rational belief but never succeeding sometimes i think of myself as a fly on a window pane crawling and and crawling and again and so on and so on â â you are one of those who seem to have been born without much interest in religion or fear of the hereafter and in a way i am like you but with a difference i in early childhood and accepted and tried to find happiness in the familiar rather than in the unknown whether i should have found the familiar enough if i hadn t met you i shall never know i ve thought a good deal on this subject and it has come to seem to me that we are too much in the habit of thinking of the intellect and the flesh as separate things whereas they are but one thing i could write a great deal on this subject but i stop as it were on the threshold of my thought for this is no time for philosophical writing i am all a tremble and though my brain is working quickly my thoughts are not mature and deliberate my brain reminds me at times of the skies that followed father s visit â skies flowing always different and always the same these last days are merciless days and i have to write to you in order to get some from thinking sometimes i stop in my walk to ask myself who i am and what i am and where i am going will yon be shocked to hear that when i awoke and heard the wind howling i nearly got out of bed to pray to god to thank him for having sent to warn me from crossing the lake i think i did say a prayer thanking him for his mercy then i that i should pray to him for grace that i might remain at home and be a good priest always but that prayer i couldn t and i suffered a great deal i know that such between belief and are neither profitable nor admirable i know that to pray to god to thank him for having saved me from death while in mortal sin and yet to find myself unable to pray to him to do his will is and i confess that my fear is now lest old will claim me before the time comes a poor weak tried mortal man am i but bein what i am i cannot be different i am calm enough now and it seems as if my sufferings were at an end but tomorrow some new fear wiu rise up like mist and i shall be enveloped what an awful thing it would be if i should find myself without will on the or the sixteenth or the of august if the wind should rise again and the lake be windy while the moon is full my chance for leaving here this summer will be at an end the water will be too cold in september and now you know all and if you don t get a letter from new york understand that what appears in the newspapers is true â that i was drowned whilst bathing i needn t for this long letter you will understand that the writing of it has taken me out of myself and that is a great gain there is no one else to whom i can write and it pleases me to know this i am sorry for my sisters in the they will believe me dead i have a brother in america the one who sent the that you used to play on so beautifully he believe in my death unless we meet in america and that is not likely i look forward to writing to you from new york two were passed pleasantly on the composition and the of this letter and not daring to it to the he it himself to and he measured the time carefully so as to get there a few minutes before the sealed up the bag he delayed in the office till she sealed it and returned home following the letter in ,3
by vi preface a wavering resolution was by recollection of some disgraceful pages but a moment after i was thinking that the of the book would create a a drama in muslin i reflected is a link between two and a book that has achieved any cannot be omitted from a collected edition so my said and they on this string until one day i flung myself out of their office and rattled down the stairs muttering what a smell of shop but in the strand near the inn the thought glided into my mind that the pages that seemed so disgraceful in memory might not seem so in print and the only way to find out if this be so the temptation continued will be to ask the next policeman the way to cross road another saw me over a dangerous crossing london is the best city in europe a third recommended a shop over yonder you ve just passed it by sir thank you thank you i cried back and no sooner was i on the other side than overcome by shyness as always in these stores of dusty literature i asked for the drama in muslin the title so timidly that the guessed me at once to be the author and began telling of the books that were doing well in first if i had any i wanted to get rid of he mentioned several he would be glad to buy whereupon in turn i grew confidential and confided to him my present failing however to him from his opinion that a drama in muslin ought to be included any you make in the new edition will keep up the price of the old he added as he wrapped up the brown paper parcel you will like the by preface vii book better than you think for thank yon thank you i cried after me and into a that i carried a delightful evening under my arm a comedy novel written with and wit i said as i turned to the twentieth page and it needs hardly any a mere re tying of a few bows that the of time has or were never tied by the author who if i remember right used to be less careful of his literary appearance than his to examine his sentences and to them as often as one might expect from an admirer not to say of walter an engaging young man rose out of the pages of his book one that walter would admire did admire one that life i added seems to have affected through his senses violently and who was may we say therefore a little over anxious to possess himself of a which would suffer him to tell all he saw heard smelt and touched upon this sudden sympathy the book of which i had read but twenty pages dropped on my knees and i sat in a reverie of the charming article should have written about this book if it had come to me for review but it couldn t have come to me i reflected for myself and the young man that wrote it were not it would be true however to say that our lives but when did the author of the drama in muslin disappear from literature his next book was of a young man it was followed by spring days he must have died in the last pages of that story for we find no trace of him in waters t by viii preface and my thoughts dropping away from the books he had written began to take pleasure in the ridiculous appearance that the author of a drama in muslin presented in the of castle as he tripped down the in early morning and a smile played round my lips as i recalled his yellow hair often standing on end his sloping shoulders and his female hands â a strange appearance which a certain vivacity of mind sometimes rendered engaging he was writing at that time a s wife in his bedroom at the hotel and i thought how different were the two visions a s wife and a drama in muslin and how the choice of these two subjects revealed him to me it was life that interested him rather than the envelope i said he sought s heart as eagerly as s and my heart went out to the three to whose i owed this pleasant evening all alone with my cat and my immediate and as i sat looking into the fire i fell to wondering how it was that the critics of the could have been blind enough to him an of a soul if ever there was one i continued whose desire to write well is apparent on every page a headlong eager uncertain style a young hound at every trace of scent but if we look beneath the style we catch sight of the young man s true self a real interest in religious questions and a hatred as lively as s of the social that drive women into the marriage market it seems strange i said myself to recollection that the critics of the failed by preface ix to notice that the theme of a drama m is the same as that of the house the very title should have pointed this out to them but they were not interested in but in morality and how they might crush a play which if it were by them would succeed in the foundations of society â their favourite phrase at the time it entered into every article written about the house â and looking upon themselves as the of society these master kept on staying and the construction till at length they were joined by some and story who feared with them for the foundations of society and these latter set themselves the task of new that would be likely to catch the popular ,3

she was about to rush away having forgotten all else but him when she remembered her father if she were to go now she must leave a letter for him explaining â telling him the story and who would play the da at his and there would be no one to see that he had his meals was she or was she not going away with to paris on thursday night the question continued at every moment to present itself whatever she was doing or saying she was always conscious of it and as the time drew near with every hour it seemed to approach and menace her she seemed to feel it beating like a pain behind her eyes and though she laughed and talked a great deal her father noticed that her animation was strained and nervous and he noticed too that in no part of their conversation was she ever entirely with him and he wondered what were the sights and scenes he faintly discerned in her changing eyes on getting up on wednesday morning she remembered by that the best train from was at three o dock and she asked herself why she had thought of this train and that she should have thought of it seemed to her like an omen her father sat opposite looking at her across the table it was all so clear in her mind that she was ashamed to sit thinking these things for thinking as clearly as she was thinking seemed equivalent to accomplishment and the differences between what she thought and what she said was so repulsive to her that she was on the point of flinging herself at his feet several times there were times when the temptation seemed to have left her when she smiled at her own weakness and folly and having herself she thought of other things it seemed to her extraordinary why she should argue and trouble about a thing which she really had no intention of doing but at that moment her heart told her that this was not so that she would go to meet in square and she was again taken with an extraordinary inward trembling our actions obey an unknown law in ourselves but which does not to our logic so we very often succeed in proving to ourselves that a certain course is the proper one for us to follow in preference to another course but when it comes for us to act we do not act as we intended and we the between what we think and what we do to a deficiency of will power man dares not admit that he acts according to his instincts that his instincts are his destiny we make up our mind to change our conduct in certain matters but we go on acting just the same and in spite of every reason was still whether she should go to meet sir it was quite clear that it was wrong for her to go and it seemed all settled in her mind but at the bottom of her heart something over which she had no kind of control told her that in the end nothing could prevent her from going to meet him she stopped amazed and terrified asking herself why she was going to do a thing which she seemed no longer even to desire in the afternoon some girl friends came to see her she played and sang and talked to them but they too noticed that she was never really with them and her friends could see that she saw and heard things invisible and to by in the middle of some trifling chatter â one colour or another was likely to be fashionable in the coming season â she had to put her hand in her pocket for her handkerchief and happened to meet the key of the square and it brought back to her in a moment the entire drama of her destiny was she going to take the three o clock train to london or to remain in with her father she thought that she would not mind whatever happened if she only knew what would happen either lot seemed better to her than the she rattled on talking with gaiety about the colour of and a party at which had sung not even hearing what she was saying wednesday evening passed with an inward vision so intense that au the outer world had from her she was like one alone in a desert and she ate without saw without seeing what she looked at spoke without knowing what she was saying heard without hearing what was said to her and moved without knowing where she was going on thursday morning the of her destiny took all colour from her cheek and her eyes were nervous what is it my girl her father said taking her hand and the music he was tying up dropped on the floor tell me something i can see is the matter it was like the breaking of a spring something seemed to give way within her and slipping on her knees she threw her arms about him i am very unhappy i wish i were dead he strove to raise her from her knees but the attitude expressed her feelings and she remained leaning her face against him nor could he any information from her at last she said raising her tearful eyes if i were to leave you father you would never forgive me but i am your only daughter and you would forgive me whatever happened we should always love one another but why should you leave me but if i love i don t mean as i love you could never love anyone so tenderly i mean quite differently don t make me say any more i am so ashamed of myself you are in love with him by yes and he has asked me to ,3

bargain he determined to give his heroes a having therefore them through the manual exercise over and over again he ordered the to strike up a quick march and his sturdy boots backwards and forwards

of the was t strengthen and new for this purpose he caused to be built a fence that reached across the island from to river being intended to the city not merely from the sudden of foreign enemies but from the of the neighbouring savages some traditions it is true have ascribed the of this wall to a later period but they are wholly for a in the manuscript dated towards the laid die of the governor

name most certainly not did he never speak of â his â his connections or relations very rarely my father unhappily was not on good terms with them they have always behaved towards him with neglect and coldness and indeed the word was uttered so that it was impossible to mistake its significance you would seem to say madam said with heightened colour that there were faults on both sides i do not believe it and in any case this is not the time to discuss the matter quite true dear girl answered the other gravely it is not the time for anything but gentleness and forgiveness and submission to god s will as regards your father s relatives the be assured that i am not come here ba their advocate against him i know little of them and i care less i only care for you for me answered you are very kind to say so but but why you would ask interrupted the other perceiving her embarrassment are you thus addressed by one who is a stranger to you and of whom as it seems you have never so much as heard p i hope i have some pity for those who are since i have the like sorrow i hope i have some sympathy with those who are since i am but it no feeling oâ humanity that miss me here there is a tie between us my dear girl far closer than that is it possible that you can make no guess at what it f shook her head but not in her limbs shook under her her breath came thick and fast with the that she was on the brink of that revelation which her life she had been yearning for but had not dared to think think a rain said her companion gently there must be a problem in mind that has often presented itself for explanation does the name of suggest nothing to you wâ f was it â was it â faltered my mother s name p it was an tenderness and pity possessed the visitor s face as she said those words and you inquired trembling in every limb for the moment she thought it just possible â that her mother herself though miss had assured her that she was dead might be standing before her upon reflection however she felt convinced that the would never have consented to assist in so cruel a deception i am your mother s sister said miss softly kiss me darling her arms had opened wide and had thrown herself into them as she spoke m a torrent of tears the tidings she had just heard coming so close upon the trying events of the morning had been too much for her don t speak don t try to speak murmured the visitor tenderly sob out your sorrow on my bosom darling for it is loyal to you and it is your natural home but why oh why murmured the girl presently as she lay like a tired child in the other s arms did papa never mention you to me we will not talk about that now my dear answered the other in an altered tone her voice had suddenly become it is a long story let it for the present that we have found one another now tell me what are your plans p in as few words as possible explained the circumstances of her position and the generous and offer that had been made to her by mrs you will of course do as you e my dear said her relative but it is plain that i am your natural guardian and as it happens i am able to offer you a home my position it is true is but a one i am housekeeper to mr charles edward of castle but the situation is a very exceptional one he lives a secluded life and leaves all domestic arrangements entirely in my hands my visit to you is known to him and the purpose of it he knows who you are and who i am and of the reasons which have caused me to um a from a thorn under a feigned if you like to come and with as my assistant and with a small but sufficient salary â i think i can make you happy of the happiness you will confer upon myself by such an arrangement i will not speak because i wish you to make your choice without pressure i will now leave you that you may do so at your leisure and free from all embarrassment let me know your decision this evening and tomorrow i shall return either to bid you good or to bring you back to what i hope will be your future home under other circumstances it would naturally have occurred to that so a leave taking on the part of her visitor after a revelation so important and was somewhat strange it in connection with the mystery so long surrounding her mother s identity she might however have ascribed it to its true cause â a desire to avoid for the present all opportunity for asking questions but as it was the girl s relief at the prospect of being left alone with the thoughts and considerations that crowded in upon her overpowered all other considerations she felt her aunt s proposal to be only of a piece with the delicacy and kindness that had distinguished her throughout the interview and far from endeavouring to it she only sought to express her happiness and gratitude

then let us together offer up our thanks to him who stretches out his hand for the of his rebellious creatures when they will not struggle for themselves but i am not sufficiently thankful yet mary perhaps the time may come when i shall bless you for what you have done oh not me you have nothing for which to bless me you should only bless that being who gave me a heart to love and a wish to save you but i am not saved yet â i commit no sin because i have no temptation i submit because is vain but i do think that if would come back and speak one land word to me i would go with him at this instant mary inwardly thanked that such a trial was ot be repeated and she bore with s day day without reproach and even without for she believed that brighter hours would come and that her beloved friend would live to see more and to feel more calmly and here let us pause awhile to what is the cause and the root of that which an inexperienced writer has attempted to describe it may be from her own want of mental power with a feeble and useless pen is it not in the cultivation and encouragement of those feelings which are not calculated to afford either satisfaction to ourselves or benefit tâ others â in the planting in our own garden those seeds which are only capable of in a totally different soil â in an desire after those pleasures which however law in themselves are and ought to be to os and a consequent looking down upon such as are set before us with indifference or disgust oh that we would teach ourselves â that some kind friend would teach us rightly to value and to use that wisdom that is given to man that he may profit withal â that wisdom which us to be that he who created us knows best for what situation we are most fitted in a world where so many different degrees of moral and physical beauty are no doubt for wise purposes permitted to exist and that when we are desiring what belongs not to our own sphere and indulging in the vain thought that in some other station we could be more virtuous and more happy we are in fact murmuring against the of providence and the wisdom of almighty what is the sum of misery brought upon the world by this dreadful delusion no pen can describe how many with wounded spirits and aching hearts have looked back to the morning of life when this important choice was made with the things that are and desire of those which might be in thousands of instances it has been the root of that fatal malady which is called a broken heart and in the present it well nigh cost the sufferer her life â her wretched earthly life not that which is eternal for in the quiet hours of a lingering illness other thoughts arose that wore a different character the strength of earthly passion was subdued the clouds of earthly prejudice were swept away before the clear of truth late awfully late when it first shines upon the steps that are descending to the grave â when it first lights up the eye that is about to close for ever chapter when the summer came and spread her smiling flowers in the path of and mary was not able to in their she was too l feeble to take and the evening to others so cool and to her were chill and damp and cheerless but she never allowed herself to complain she never spoke of italy and the name of never passed her lips only sometimes when she drew shivering to the fire mary could see that the tears were in her eyes and then she knew that her spirit had flown away to distant lands it was but twelve short months since that proud came into the neighbourhood since was rich in the possession of youth and health and happiness and now what a picture of melancholy did her faded form present â of melancholy but not of despair for she never murmured and sometimes her countenance would be up by a smile that showed how much she was striving against the tide of painful and emotions which often seemed ready to rush in and her reason it was a faint and sickly smile that told more than tears what her heart had passed through like the first gleam of sunshine on the landscape which the tempest had laid waste â the first of the trees when the has torn their branches the autumn of this year was unusually mild and genial and so gentle and was the progress of s disorder that mary saw no reason for alarming apprehension it was undoubtedly a frail to which her spirit held but there were no symptoms of immediate danger much depended upon care and quiet and here all circumstances were in her favour for no one could have a better nurse than mary and no place could be more quiet than the village of l when the were not there to disturb it day day passed on with its little routine of domestic duties rumour was silent and scandal slept for was ill and poor and those who had once envied could now afford to pity her on one fine sabbath morning in september when mary returned firom church she found thai her had risen without any assistance bad dressed herself and was seated in a high backed arm chair formerly occupied by her father you should not have done this said mary you know it is too much for you i believe now that it is too much for me but i did not think so an hour ago

gross ignorance of the sports of the field was almost a woman this was when the other guests gun in hand were brushing the dew from the tops or struggling through the or while they urged their wild career after the red dog with the tail mr stayed within doors with the lady of the house sprung a great deal of scandal for the very ladies who had and cut her off from the society of her sex were prompt to seize upon this companionship as a proof of own good ment it was very lucky that they had shown no such weakness toward her as some â though to say the truth miss pole had been the only one â from mistaken charity would have suggested this unhappy young person was carrying on a disgraceful under her own roof and within six months of her marriage but what better could be expected of her considering her relatives and of course they wronged her and mr also he was above all things a gentleman â not of the man of honor and the idea with which these excellent people him had never so much as entered his head he admired but at least as much for her pluck and independence as for her beauty and he liked her best of all because in his judgment â and with respect to men and women at least it was no mean one â she was so good a wife to richard she never told him of her fears for her husband but he understood them as well as the and subtle though they were which she made to win him from his wild courses and to teach him to find his happiness in home and they touched him all the more because he knew that they were in vain a man need not go to to bet any more than he need go to the city to and richard though he had ceased to attend race courses made up his little book as usual and lost his thousands by it did she know this wondered or did she not at last the matter was put beyond a doubt on a certain sunday when they had all been to church together â for the young squire attended morning service in the most manner â the walking home with them ventured notwithstanding his wife s presence to congratulate mrs upon her fine voice you are quite an acquisition to our village choir he said i am used to singing in church said simply you know i used to sing at st s mrs she could have hardly felt more shocked if had referred to her stage experiences mr when turning over the leaves of s music for her that evening as usual referred to this conversation and of it remarked how she and not without favorable results â in the cultivation of her voice it may be of use to me some day she said smiling when bank notes are all gone and spent these other notes may be most excellent she spoke in jest but her companion felt from that moment that feared the worst less black than painted day of he judged rightly but there was a reason known only to herself that was now her more than ever to make provision for the future chapter good what cake of it when the shooting and hunting were over was the time as regarded richard s content with life for though it is possible for an idle man without a love for books and who is no to without it requires a certain of disposition and moreover that he should either never have devoted himself to the pursuit of pleasure or else have been of it and the case of richard did not fulfil these conditions it so happened however that the lease of one of his largest farms had fallen in and as the tenant was not desirous to renew richard took it into his own hands in this novel occupation he took a quite for interest and had the occurrence happened earlier there is no saying but that his lines of life might have taken a wholly different direction but his father before him had had as we know no turn for pursuits and had never dreamed of any taste for them lying in his son richard wholly inexperienced and difficult to be ad unless a certain was employed not usually to be found in farm did not find himself in a favorable position for this new pursuit to a profit but the loss was nothing in his case as compared witli the gain of an occupation that attracted him which strange to say he found there was a certain simplicity in dick s character all his wild ways which now seemed to have discovered a natural channel of action he rose with the lark instead as before of retiring to rest about that period and went to bed at a wholesome hour he passed his days on horseback or on foot in his fields he bought at a high price and sold at a low one and gave promise of becoming a farmer with results only slightly more disastrous than usual he had plenty of method which indeed he flattered himself was his strong point but it was not of the right sort experience was wanting to him and he purchased it â like everything else he dearly but to the loving eyes that were looking further for him than into his yearly balance sheet the experiment was answering admirably when a misfortune occurred that crushed the hope herself was taken ill the fact of playing so long to a very audience had tried her nerves in many ways even richard s love which to do him justice never was insufficient to support her under such adverse circumstances and indeed was in itself a source of weakness since but for ,12

cows and oxen for sale and pig with herds of swine and farmers with cart loads of and all other produce of the soil now and then a farmer s red faced wife trotted along on horseback with butter and cheese in two large the people of the with country and other visitors from the neighborhood walked hither and thither trading quarrelling and making just such a bustle as their fathers and had made half a century before in one part of the street there a with a ridiculous merry who kept both grown people and children in a roar of laughter on the opposite side was the old stone church of with ivy climbing up its walls and partly its windows by ic â there was a clock in the gray tower of the ancient church and the hands on the dial plate had now almost reached the hour of noon at this hour of the market a strange old gentleman was seen making his way among the crowd he was very tall and and wore a brown coat and small clothes with black stockings and shoes on his head was a three hat beneath which a gray wig thrust itself out all in disorder the old gentleman the people aside and forced his way through the midst of them with a singular kind of gait rolling his body hither and thither so that he needed twice as much room as any other person there make way sir he would cry out in a loud harsh voice when somebody happened to interrupt his progress â sir you intrude your person into the public what a queer old fellow this is l the people among themselves hardly knowing whether to laugh or to be angry but when they looked into the venerable stranger s face not the most thoughtless among them dared to offer him the least impertinence though his features were and distorted with the and though his eyes were dim and yet there was something of au and wisdom in his look which impressed them all with awe so they stood aside to let by ic stories â him pass and the old gentleman made his way across the market place and paused near the corner of the ivy church just as he reached it the clock struck twelve on the very spot of ground where the stranger now stood some aged people remembered that old michael johnson had formerly kept his the little children who had once bought picture books of him were now yes here is the very spot muttered the old gentleman to himself there this unknown personage took his stand and removed the three hat from his head it was the hour of the day what with the hum of human voices the of cattle the of pigs and the laughter caused by the merry the market place was in very great confusion but the stranger seemed not to notice it any more than if the silence of a desert were around him he was in his own thoughts he raised his brow to heaven as if in prayer sometimes he bent his head as if an weight of sorrow were upon him it increased the of his aspect that there was a motion of his head and an almost continual tremor throughout his frame with singular and of his features the hot sun blazed upon his by ic t is f bead but he seemed not to feel its a dark cloud swept across the sky and rain drops into the market place but the stranger not the shower the people began to gaze at the mysterious old gentleman with superstitious fear and wonder who could he be whence did he come wherefore was he standing bare headed in the market place even the school boys left the merry and came to gaze with wide open eyes at this tall old man there was a cattle in the village who had recently made a journey to the market in london no sooner had this man thrust his way through the throng and taken a look at the unknown personage than he to one of his acquaintances i say neighbor would ye like to know who this old gentleman is ay that i would replied neighbor for a chap i never saw in my life somehow it makes me feel

though the old man s troubles had been over so many years â had he forgiven himself for in such a pang upon his heart and now in his old age he had come hither to do penance by standing at noon day in the market place of on the very spot where michael johnson had once kept his the aged and illustrious man had done what the poor boy refused to do by thus ,2

loving angels guarding the crystal gifts they had bestowed although the range as seen from this mountain top seems regular in its as if the main were simple and continuous it is on the contrary far from simple in front of the highest ranks of peaks are others of the same form with their own and lower peaks before these and yet lower ones with their and valleys and rise beyond as far as the eye can r travels in reach and clusters of higher peaks here and there closely crowded together clusters too of needles and innumerable like trees in groves everywhere the peaks seem comparatively slender and closely packed as if nature had here been trying to see how many noble well dressed mountains could be crowded into one grand range the black rocks too steep for snow to lie upon were brought into sharp relief by white clouds and snow and and these again were and made plain by the rocks the so displayed are of every form some crawling through and valley like monster glittering others like broad pouring over cliffs into shadowy others with their main trunks winding through narrow display long white finger like descending from the of others lie back in fountain walled in all around save at the lower edge over which they pour in blue snow too lay in folds and patches of every form on blunt rounded in curves lines and narrow ornamental among the summit peaks and in broad wings on smooth slopes and on many a and lower ridge there lay heavy over curling and smooth white where wind driven pressed and and packed into every form and in every possible place and condition i never before had seen so richly a range or so many awe inspiring inaccessible mountains crowded together if a line were peak drawn east and west from the peak on which i stood and extended both ways to the horizon cutting the whole round landscape in two equal parts then all of the south half would be bounded by these icy peaks which would seem to curve around half the horizon and about twenty degrees more though extending in a general straight or but curved line the deepest and and highest of all this wilderness of peaks lie to the they are probably from about nine to twelve thousand feet high springing to this elevation from near the sea level the peak on which these observations were made is somewhere about seven thousand feet high and from here i estimated the height of the range the highest peak of all or that seemed so to me lies to the westward at an estimated distance of about one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles only its solid white summit was visible possibly it may be the peak of st now look northward around the other half of the horizon and instead of countless peaks crowding into the sky you see a low brown region heaving and swelling in gentle curves apparently scarcely more waved than a rolling the so called of several forks of the upper are visible but even where best seen in the and middle ground of the picture they are like mere sunken making scarce perceptible marks on the landscape while the tops of the highest mountain show only small patches of snow and no peak on which i stood is the highest travels in point of a spur that puts out from the main range in a direction it seems to have been a rounded broad backed ridge which has been into its present irregular form by short some of which a mile or two long are still at work as i lingered gazing on the vast show luminous shadowy clouds seemed to increase in glory of color and motion now the highest peaks with infinite tenderness of touch now hovering above them like over their nests when night was drawing near i ran down the slopes thanking god for the gift of this great day the setting sun fired the clouds all the world seemed new born every thing even the commonest was seen in new light and was looked at with new interest as if never seen before the plant people seemed glad as if rejoicing with me the little ones as well as the trees while every feature of the peak and its seemed to know what i had been about and the depth of my joy as jf they could read faces chapter viii of the next day i planned an excursion to the so called dirt the most interesting to indians and steamer men of all the from its mysterious floods i left the steamer for the an hour or two before sunset the captain kindly me his and two of his indian deck hands who seemed much puzzled to know what the rare service required of them might mean and on leaving bade a merry adieu to their companions we on the west side of the river opposite the front of the in a spacious valley surrounded by snowy mountains thirteen small were in sight and four it was a fine serene evening and the highest peaks were wearing of cloud stuff i had my supper before leaving the steamer so i had only to make a spread my blanket and lie down the indians had their own and lay beside their own fire the dirt is noted among the river men as being subject to violent flood once or twice a year usually in the late summer the of this stream is three or four miles wide where it fronts the river and the many rough channels with which it is and the trees and huge that its surface manifest the power of the floods

â come solomon said a large broad shouldered man with a face in which were singularly blended the principles of fun and ferocity come solomon none of your preaching here so soon â you know you re not up to the praying point yet nor within four of it so as you say yourself wait for your gifts my lad ah tom replied solomon with a smile always â always fond of a harmless and jest my name sir added he is m i have the honour to be law agent to the castle property and occasionally to business with our friend m here the waiter entered with a glass and and desired them to mo up the this however i declined as not being yet m accustomed to punch to be able to drink it without i begged however to be allowed to substitute a little cold and water in its stead i m sir observed another strong looking man that you are likely to prove but a cool on our hands i never saw the man that his good for much sir said solomon you need not feel at the tone of voice and familiarity in which these persons address you or me they are so to speak sturdy and independent men who to the natural boldness of their character add on such occasions as this something of the equality and license that are necessarily to be found in a orange lodge i am myself here i trust on different and higher principles indeed it is from a purely motive that i come as well as to give them the benefit of a frail but not i would hope altogether example their language makes me often feel how much i stand in need of grace and how good it is sometimes for me to be tempted within my strength i also drink punch here lest by declining it i might get into too strong a feeling of pride in probably possessing greater gifts and i need not say sir that a watchful christian will be the irish agent slow to miss any opportunity of keeping himself humble it is then for this purpose that i sometimes when among these men make myself even as one of them and humble myself always with an eye to even to the fourth or fifth cup but i trust sir that these christian from your ground are generally rewarded without i trust i may say so these sacrifices of mine are not without their own appropriate indeed it is seldom that such stretches of duty on the right side and for the improvement of others are made altogether in vain for instance after the humility â if i can call it so â of the third cup i am rewarded with an easy of the spiritual man â a greater sense of inward freedom â an elevation of the soul â a of spirit that a calm serene happiness through my whole being that sh must be delightful it is delightful but it is what these men â i do not wish to call them lest i fall â it is however what these men â or indeed any merely man cannot feel this however i feel to be a communication made to me that in this thing i should not for the time stop and i feel that i am not free to pass m the fourth or fifth cup knowing as how greater freedom and additional privileges will be granted are the stages marked sir between the fourth and fifth cups my friend â there is a beauty sir in the economy of this that is not to be concealed for instance the line between the third and fourth cup is much better marked and no doubt for wiser purposes than is that between the fourth and fifth at the fourth my spirit is filled with strong tendencies â and it is given to me to address the lodge with something like effect but at the fifth this spirit rises still higher and as the form of praise and spiritual songs and political in this whole assembly i am sorry to say that there is but one other humble individual who if i may so speak is gifted and goes along with me as they say step by step and cup by cup until we reach the highest order which is praise but indeed to persons so gifted in their liquor drinking is decidedly a religious exercise that person is the little fellow to the right of the red faced man up yonder the little fellow i mean who is pale in the face and wants an eye his name is bob he is grand by appointment to the lodge and the irish agent all the in the province from principle for he is between you and me a christian man of high privileges as for our little touches of during the fifth cup the only draw back is that no matter what the measure of the be whether long or short bob is sure to sing it either to the tune of lie down or the water they being the only two he can manage a circumstance which forces us however otherwise united to part company in the melody unless when moved by compassion for poor bob i occasionally join him in lie down or the other tune for the purpose of him as a christian and an at this time it was with something like effort that he or i could hear each other as we spoke and by the way it was quite evident that little solomon was very nearly in all his glory from the very slight of language which might be observed in his conversation it occurred to me now that as solomon s heart was a little open and as the tide of conversation flowed both loud and tumultuous it was a very good ,15
long cry and the crash of broken glass was heard what did you hit me like that for he cried holding himself with both hands you beast you i ll teach you to keep me waiting you would you do you want another go into the sitting room dick obeyed humbly and in silence his only hope was that the landlady had not been awakened and he felt uneasily at his pockets through which he feel the gin dripping down his legs well have you brought the drink i sent you for where is it well replied dick desirous of at any price it was in my pocket but when you hit me with that stick you broke it i broke it cried her eyes glistening with fire yes dear you did it wasn t my fault wasn t your fault oh you horrid wretch you put it there on purpose that i should break it oh now really he cried shocked by the of the accusation how could i know that you were going to hit me there i don t know and i don t care what s that to me but what i m sure of is that you always want to spite me that you hate me that you would wish to see me dead so that you might marry mrs forest i can t think how you can say such things i ve often told you that mrs forest and i oh don t bother me i m not such a fool i know she keeps you and she will have to pay me a drink tonight go and get another bottle of gin and mind you pay for it with the money she gave you to day yes she shall stand me a drink to night a s wife i give you my word i haven t another penny piece upon me it s just the accident but dick did not get time to finish the sentence he was interrupted by a heavy blow across the face and like a that has tasted bloody she rushed at him again screaming all the while oh you ve no money you liar you liar so you would make me believe that she does not give you money that you have no money of hers in your pocket you would keep it all for yourself but you shan t no you shan t for i will tear it from you and throw it in your face oh that filthy money that filthy money the patience with which he bore with her was truly he might easily have her to the ground with one stroke but he contented himself with merely off the blows she aimed at him from his great height and strength he was easily able to do this and she struck at him with her little arms as she might against a door take down your hands she screamed exasperated to a last degree you would strike me would you you beast i know you would her rage had now reached its height showing her clenched teeth she at the mouth the eyes from their and her voice grew more and more harsh and but although the excited brain gave strength to the muscles and energy to the will she could do nothing against dick and suddenly becoming conscious of this she rushed to the fireplace and seized the with one sweep of the arm she cleared the mantel board and the mirror came in for a tremendous blow as she advanced round the table her weapon but heedless of the shattered glass she followed in pursuit of dick who continued to defend himself a s wife with a chair and it is difficult to say how long this combat might have lasted if dick s attention had not been interrupted by the view of the landlady s face at the door and so touched was he by the woman s dismay when she looked upon her broken furniture that he forgot to guard himself from the took advantage of the occasion and whirled the weapon round her head he saw it descending in time and half off the blow but it came down with awful force on the and glancing off inflicted a severe wound the landlady screamed murder and dick seeing that matters had come to a crisis closed in upon his wife and by and struggles her and forced her into a chair oh dear oh dear you re all bleeding sir cried the landlady she has nearly killed you never mind me but what are we to do i think she has gone mad this time that s what i think said the landlady trying to make herself heard above s shrieks well then go and fetch a doctor and let s hear what he has to say replied dick as he changed his grip on s arm for in a desperate struggle she had nearly succeeded in herself free the landlady retreated towards the door well will you go yes yes i ll run at once you d better the mad woman after her i ll give it to you let me go let me go will you but dick never ceased his hold of her and the blood dripping upon her in large drops into her ears and down into her neck and bosom you re on me you beast you filthy beast i ll pay you out for this then she perceived that it a s wife was blood the of her voice changed and in terror she screamed murder murder he s me is there no one here to save me the minutes seemed like dick felt himself growing faint but should he lose his power over her before the doctor arrived the consequences might be fatal to himself so he struggled with her for very life at last the door was opened and a man walked ,3
opportunity of saying audibly â this is the lady i have so recommended the brother was a decided improvement upon mr frank he really had some notion of books and made himself so well pictures of private life l acquainted with the history of his own estate that he could talk about roman roads and the roman method of walls alas that refinement should spoil half our pleasures while it makes us but a poor by the other half until they are too exquisite to last on by the vanity of being the star of this evening i laid aside all the refinement i could spare without myself and was hale fellow well met with all the stout country old and young who drank their dozen cups or tea eat their proportion of cake talked and played cards at mrs s party it was for aught i know a pleasant evening to all the other guests â to me it was hot on the following morning while my friend was occupied as usual in her domestic greatly increased on this occasion by the eating and drinking of the preceding day i was seated alone and while lost in a kind of reverie composed of floating pictures of my fate and indefinite speculations as to the real character of this mr how he would be likely to himself at the head of his own table and many other strange thoughts for a stranger as i was then â the man himself appeared and me with the familiarity of an old acquaintance he said his man had brought along with him a capital lady s and if i was fond of riding it should be immediately i looked out the sun was bright the atmosphere fresh and i consented and we set off for a long morning s ride the man who wishes to make interest with a woman does well to lend her a good horse and accompany her through green lanes and slopes where the of the hoofs is scarcely heard upon the soft turf whatever affords us real pleasure we are disposed to like and the transition from the animal to its master is not so great but that a kind and grateful heart may sometimes be induced to make it mr and i soon discovered that a summer s morning was not the best time for riding and his sister s early tea afforded us a much more interesting opportunity of through the lanes sometimes while the lengthened shadows lay in cool relief upon the ground and sometimes when the moon was shining through the silvery mists of twilight how of en did i wish during these excursions that my kind companion would be willing to remain silent and just keep a little way behind or that i could close my eyes to his person and my ears to his coarse with what satisfaction could i then have looked from the hill where he took me to obtain a distant view of the domain which he was proud to call his and with what fondness might i have the animal which he was pleased to call mine when a man gives you his horse it has a serious sound and the woman who does not wish an offer of himself to follow would do well to ride no more it would certainly have been one of the last of my wishes that mr should present his large hand to me and yet i rode out with him again and again helping his few ideas with so many of my own and supplying him with words when at a loss as if from the very sympathy of my mind that we did vastly well together and he at least was perfectly satisfied for my habitual mode of appearing pleased left him little room to doubt that i was so with him i was living too amongst those who looked upon him as a sort of superior being and i sometimes questioned whether i should not be more fastidious than wise to throw away an opportunity of making what his sister was pleased to call a catch amongst the many arts which i had learned in my intercourse with the world was that of off or bringing on an offer of marriage with so much tact and delicacy that none but the most penetrating or the most ill natured could accuse me of design on the present occasion however i had to contend with so strong a determination to that fatal point that i found i must either give the pains of pleasing up my pleasant altogether involve myself in a very disagreeable or leave the hospitable roof of the where i was at least sure of a and genuine welcome nor was it until i resolved upon this last alternative that i felt the strong hold these cheerful and people had upon my regard by their habits and laying before them my more extensive knowledge of facts and persons and they wanted nothing more i had become a general favourite and had good reason to believe that the early and late parties of mrs frank had never been so brilliant before i had not at first quite understood what people of vulgar and empty minds are most in want of for amusement but i was perfectly now and could at the of my laugh at round backs and crooked noses wonder whether those who were better dressed than myself had paid their christmas bills set down all for my conversation with a little country and finally fill up the chapter of folly by i did not understand thus had my time been spent and because thus spending it had obtained for me unbounded admiration i felt some regret at taking leave of my friend mrs and receiving the tenderest of her wealthy brother which however he kindly promised with a look intended to be expressive should not be for ,7

in our plan no source of hope and consequent disgust and disappointment exists all who join us will know with certainty what they none but ardent and spirits will join us because we go for the war we shall have no six months soldier whose heart and face will be tamed towards home every step that he takes towards canada and whose dragging chain will be almost too heavy to be borne by him before he gets half way to i begin to apprehend that there will be no war the blood of has been washed from the decks of the and we have never learned how to bear malice besides will and frighten the british into the appearance at least of good humour with us i think however we had better urge on our a c c q ment orders us to ground our arms the progress we shall make will be so much ground gained in the event of a new you will see the opinion by which stopped the trial for treason the trial for will begin to day it will soon stopped then a motion to commit and send on to which will not be heard yours wm from the philosophical tone of our next extract we infer that the and its hopes had fallen into some danger of firom the jealousy entertained against it by the of the state this seems to have been the first event in the life of the writer which gave him a taste of the disappointments to which all ambitious aspirations are exposed and therefore to have filled his mind with reflections which were not less natural to the occasion than of a character to be frequently repeated in the course of his succeeding years to september my dear friend jf as to the it has given me a new view of human nature and of my countrymen and has i confess filled my heart with the most melancholy for their future destiny so easily and so easily even against their friends what difficulty will an artful villain ever have in them even to their own ruin this is a new to virtue it is into our own hearts that we are at last to look for happiness it is the only source on which we can count with certainty these truths so long preached by philosophers and were never before brought home so strongly to my conviction as by the example of this thank god we are not without this source of happiness on the present occasion but what is to become of the people what is to become of the republic since they are thus easily to be these are subjects which suggest most painful to me for it seems that no no patriotism of intention can shield a man even from censure and and the people who themselves mean to do what is right are still capable of being so as to think it proper and even virtuous to censure and a man for an act not only flowing from the purest motives but really well judged for their benefit and happiness iâ ap political reflections how hard is it for a republican to admit the truth that a and judicious action may nevertheless draw down upon its authors the the censure and even the curses of the people i that no argument no appeal to reason and law and right can save him from me consequences yet it is certainly true it requires some in a man who receives this conviction from experience to prevent him from drawing himself into his shell and caring only about himself g then if every virtuous man should take that resolution the theatre would be given up to solely and we should soon all go to together and this would not be quite so so we must do duty and leave the issues to heaven if the people curse us our own hearts will bless us if we have troubles at sea boys we have pleasures on shore and admitting all these what form of government is there that has not more and worse so we bring up the lee way with a wet sail as poor frank used to say we are on the point of yielding the scheme so far as the field officers are concerned consult and let me hear what you think

of our friends in the country and while we were considering it i thought it proper that you should consider it too it is my own opinion that there would be more dignity as well as propriety in our withdrawing but the majority here urge with some reason that we stand committed to the captains i the abandoned and should the express terms of the contract which we our selves proposed by them at this time it seems to be the opinion that under these circumstances we had better suffer the scheme to die a natural death it is not even yet but that the plan may be executed from and we have

plate fig the seat c in road the gallop as to the character of the gallop when we press a horse in the trot beyond his capacity or him with the legs while we raise or retain him with the hand we compel him to lift his two fore feet after each other which the gallop the near fore foot is first raised from the ground then the off fore foot which however passes the other and they come to the ground in the same order the near fore foot making one beat and the off fore foot another that being the most advanced or leading foot the hind feet follow in the same manner the near marking a third beat and the off hind foot passing forward and marking a fourth beat thus when this pace is united and true the feet mark a regular sharp and quick time of one two three four the perfection of the in road riding the of taking the right hand of all you pass is well known but there are some exceptions which are thus noticed by mr in his style â in riding the road a man on horseback be in your way leading another horse always dash by the led one you might otherwise set the man s horse and perhaps throw him off and you can get but a kick or two by my instructions â in passing a wagon or any tremendous should it run very near a bank and there be but a ditch and an open country on the other side if you on business and in a hurry dash up the bank without hesitation f r should you take the other side and the horse shy at the carriage you may be carried many hundred yards out of your road whereas by a little of courage you need only the wheel fly up the bank and by slipping or tumbling down into the road again go little or nothing out of your way the gallop gallop consists in the of the limbs the union of the horse the of the action and the regularity of the time the gallop is of three that of the that of the hunter and that of the pleasure horse commonly called the the last of these is by far the most difficult as it requires skill to fore and throw the horse on his in the gallop as in the trot there is a leading foot on a straight line it is with which fore leg the horse leads provided the hind leg of the same side follows it but to lead always with the same leg is injurious in galloping to the right the horse must lead with the inward or oflf fore leg followed by the off hind leg this action is termed true or united â plate xl shows this in the in galloping to the left he must lead with the inward or near fore leg followed by the near this also is termed true or united f the in particular to put the horse to the from rest at any spot or from any pace he must be pressed with the legs or animated with the tongue and at the same time by a motion of the fingers and a little raising of the hand be invited to raise the fore legs if he do not obey this the animation must be increased and the hand kept more firm to pre in galloping to the right if the horse lead with the off fore leg and near hind leg or if he lead with the near fore leg and off hind leg he is said to be if in galloping to the right he lead with both near legs he is said to be false t in galloping to the left if the horse lead with the near fore leg and off hind leg or if he lead with the off fore leg and near hind leg he is said to be jf in galloping to the left he lead with both off legs he is said to be false vent trotting and this will to raise fore legs together it is also necessary to direct the foot he is to lead with that of course is the inner which he will readily take by patting the in by means of the opposite thereby him to advance the inner side as the position of the horse renders necessary a corresponding position of the it will readily be seen that whichever side the horse leads with the rider s on that side must be rather more turned in towards the saddle and the hip on that side brought more forward and consequently that the other must be a little turned outward and the hip brought backward and all this more or less in proportion to the position of the horse this turn of the hip effects a turn of the body the hands are carried with it and at the same time kept up rather above than below the elbow and quite steady that the of every step and the support given by the hand may be felt the rider s head is of course to be directed â o the horse s nose his eye glancing on the ground the horse s fore feet go over if the horse strike off with the wrong leg false or the rider at the first corner must endeavor by an additional feeling of the inward rein and application of the outward leg to make him change and lead with the proper one when he leads with the proper leg the hand must resume its usual position the rider bending him a little by the inward rein the fingers if necessary to let him advance but the hand kept up and every felt of the fore feet coming to the ground there is far more skill displayed in ,15

think of what they still call dinner tells us that such a blaze of splendor was once to be seen on the way it might be so â it is now to be seen nowhere but in london as to stage their form seems to have arrived at perfection it prodigious strength with almost incredible lightness many of them not weighing more than about and being kept so much nearer the ground than formerly they are of course considerably safer nothing indeed can be more favorable to safety than the build of modern the boots being let down between the springs keep the load and consequently the centre of gravity low the wheels of many of them are secured by patent boxes and in every part of them the best materials are used the cost of of this description is from â to â but they are generally hired from the maker at id to per mile it is said to be the intention of government to substitute light carriages with two horses for the present drawn by four on this a writer in the review that when the mail coach of the present the era of has however now arrived and there remains no need for such an experiment â ed fifth edition day starts from london for a man may safely bet a hundred to one that she arrives to her time but let a light two horse vehicle set out on the same errand and the would strangely alter it is quite a mistaken â notion that a carriage is less liable to accidents for being light on the contrary she is more liable to them than one that is laden in proportion to her powers in the latter case she runs steadily along and is but little disturbed by any obstacle or jerk she may meet on the road in the former she is constantly on the jump as call it and her iron parts are very liable to snap it may in this place be observed that no stage coach should be permitted to travel the road with wheels secured only by the common it is in consequence of this that innumerable accidents have happened to from wheels coming off and in these improving and fast times such chances should not be allowed to exist it may not be uninteresting to the to learn from the same clever and experienced writer how a coach is worked suppose a number of persons to enter into a contract to horse a coach eighty miles each proprietor having twenty miles in which case he is said to cover both sides of the ground or to and fro at the of twenty eight days a settlement takes place and if the gross of the coach be â per mile there will be â to divide between the four after the following charges have been duty to government or hire of the coach to the coach makers two s wages wages rent or charge of offices at each end and washing the these charges may amount to â which leaves â to keep eighty horses and to pay the horse for a period of twenty eight days or nearly â to each proprietor for the expenses of his twenty horses being â per week for each horse thus it appears that a fast coach properly appointed cannot pay unless its gross amount to â per double mile and that even then the proprietor s depend on the luck he has with his stock coach horses a great change has lately taken place as to the english coach horse and this is the foundation of many other accompanying changes fifty years ago the putting a thorough bred horse into harness would have been deemed preposterous in the carriages of gentlemen the black or bay â each one remove from the cart horse â was the prevailing sort and six miles an hour was the extent of the pace now however this shouldered round legged animal something between a coach and a horse as fat as an ox and with all his at first starting not capable of more than six miles an hour and rendered useless by a day s hard work is no more seen and instead of him we find a horse as tall deep rising in the in the shoulders flat in the legs with more strength and with the speed the animal formerly in use cost from to l â two hundred guineas is now an every day price for a horse and guineas for a coach horse for a private gentleman s work a pair of handsome coach horses fit for london and well broken and cannot be purchased under guineas and even job masters often give much more for them to let out to their customers the origin of this superior kind of coach horse is still however the bay confined principally to and with perhaps on one side and on the other bnt difficult to be met with pine in either county indeed and the of in

coach horse most in with his arched crest and high action from the same mare and the thorough bred of sufficient height but not of so much substance we obtain the four in hand and superior horse from less height and more substance we derive the hunter and better sort of from the we have the the and the common carriage horse the best coach horse is a tall strong over sized hunter the has many of the qualities of the hunter on a small scale there is some deception however even as to the best of these improved coach horses they nobly through the streets and they are capable ,15
these agents themselves might as well be timber that a change from robbery and ruin to a permanent rational policy is needed nobody with the knowledge of american forests will deny in the east and along the northern pacific coast where the is abundant comparatively few care keenly what becomes of the trees so long as fuel and lumber are not dear but in the rocky mountains and and where the forests are and where the of the depends upon public opinion is growing stronger every year in favor of permanent by the government of all the forests that cover the sources of the streams even in these regions long accustomed to steal are now willing and anxious to buy lumber for their mills under cover of law some possibly from a late second growth of honesty but most especially the small mill owners simply because it no longer pays to steal where all may not only steal but also destroy and ia particular because it costs about as much to steal timber for one mill as for ten and therefore the ordinary can no longer with the large many of the find that timber is already becoming scarce and dear on a for the better by o is now on â i i our national the hills around their mills and they too are asking for protection of forests at le t against fire the slow going farmers also are beginning to realize that when the timber is stripped from the mountains the streams dry up in summer and are in winter that soil scenery and everything slips off with the trees so of course they are coming into the ranks of tree friends of all the magnificent forests around the great lakes once the property of the united states scarcely any belong to it now they have disappeared in lumber and smoke mostly smoke and the government got not one cent for them only the land they were growing on was considered valuable and two and a half dollars an acre was charged for it here and there in the southern states there are still considerable of government land but these are comparatively unimportant only the forests of the west are significant in size and value and these although still great are rapidly vanishing last summer of the forests of the pacific coast range the united states commission not find a single that remained in the hands of the government the state of recently appropriated two and fifty thousand to a block of land near for a state park a larger national park should be made in or the american forests under the timber and stone act of which might well have been called the dust and ashes act any citizen of the united states could take up one hundred and sixty acres of timber land and by paying two dollars and a half an acre for it obtain title there was some virtuous effort made with a view to limit the operations of the act by requiring that the should make that he was entering the land exclusively for his own use and by not allowing any association to enter more than one hundred and sixty acres nevertheless under this act wealthy have obtained title to from ten thousand to twenty thousand acres or more the plan was usually as follows a mill company desirous of getting title to a large body of or sugar pine land first the eyes and ears of the land agents and then hired men to enter the land they wanted and immediately deed it to the company after a compliance with the law false swearing in ae wilderness against the government being held of no account in one case which came under the observation of mr it was the practice of a lumber company to hire the entire crew of every vessel which might happen to touch at any port in the belt to enter one hundred and sixty acres each and immediately deed the land to the company in consideration of the company s paying our national all expenses and giving the jolly sailors fifty dollars apiece for their trouble by such methods have our magnificent and much of the sugar pine forests of the been absorbed by foreign and resident uncle sam is not often called a fool in business matters yet he has sold millions of acres of timber land at two dollars and a half an acre on which a single tree was worth more than a hundred dollars but this land has been and nothing can be done now about the crazy bargain according to the everlasting law of even the at less than one per cent of its value are making little or nothing on account of fierce competition the trees are and about half of each giant is left on the ground to be converted into smoke and ashes the better half is into choice lumber and sold to citizens of the united states or to foreigners thus the country of its

ruins more than a thousand years old but not one acre in a hundred is allowed to raise a new forest growth on the contrary all the brains religion and superstition of the neighborhood are ,13
what is now commonly allied the ideas of light and heat in tlie selection of animals or individual objects thrown in from choice to a picture the landscape painter finds wide scope for tlie display of his poetic feeling the introduction of cattle is an error into which none could who was not either a in his art or an wedded to the best system of live stock and why because our associations with fat cattle whatever satisfaction they may yield in the kitchen or are decidedly too gross and vulgar in their nature to afford any gratification in a poem or a picture far be it from the writer of this chapter to the value of fat cattle or any other agricultural produce but everything has an appropriate place and there is but one kind of picture in which fat cattle would be in theirs i will leave the reader to judge how far that kind is worthy of the art let the subject be a red brick farm house with a bam extending on one side and a square plot of garden ground on the other circular com and a red pigeon house in front with fields in the distance smoothed down by constant culture and with neatly at right angles all over them fat cattle would unquestionably be well placed in tlie and the picture merely as such would possess the beauty of harmony in all its art though it might be impossible to call it poetical after an extreme case the mind by a natural effort rushes towards its opposite in search of that gratification which it has failed to find and the idea which now presents itself is that of a wild and varied landscape with distant mountains rugged deep groves green slopes foaming and wandering upon the banks of one of these beneath the shade of a wide spreading the artist places immediately in the no less a personage than while the dance before him to the music of his and winged loves and graces from rock to rock or float upon the air does the picture please no because in the first instance it is not to nature and wherever the conceit of man s imagination breaks in upon the harmony and pathos which belong to nature alone the poetical charm must in some measure be destroyed and secondly because in the picture of a landscape the ideal ot rural scenery should be distinct and which it is impossible it should be where characters so important as and the are introduced but let us still retain the landscape and see whether something better may not be made of it the artist who enters into the real spirit of poetry will place upon the broken of the mountain a few shaggy and perhaps a solitary a wanderer from the herd will be stooping over the side of the stream to lave its thirst in the cool waters of the forest the he will witli the rich colouring of innumerable wild plants woven into a gorgeous carpet which here and there gives place to a projecting rock or to the wild of a small silvery torrent that up from a gray stone fountain and filling a rude shoots forth in and then loses itself amongst the thick leaves and overhanging the little narrow bed which with the strife of ages it has worked out for its own repose beside this fountain a woman is standing not an angel or a goddess but a simple peasant woman whose dress coarse but gorgeous in its colouring with the rich and varied tints of the she has my notion of not only tke forms which nâ produce bat also the ud internal and as i may call it of the human mind and imagination â sir the poetry op painting just filled her from the pure stream and is resting it for a moment on the side of the stone before she back her lonely way to the s cottage whose low roof may be seen half hid by the trees here is at once a picture which by awakening our calling to mind a thousand delightful recollections and giving birth to tlie most agreeable associations our attention delights our fancy and more clearly than would a volume of what it is that the poetry of painting and in this manner the most pleasing may be composed out of materials extremely simple and sometimes even barren in perhaps no one was ever more intimately acquainted with the poetry of this of the art than in all his of the savage dignity of nature may be found a perfect correspondence between the subjects which he chose and his manner of treating them everything is of a piece his rocks trees sky even to his handling have the same rude and wild character which his figures as the art of poetry may be under several different heads so that of painting has to the poetical observer many distinctions of character not laid down in the of the schools leaving the more celebrated productions of the to which there might doubtless be found corresponding specimens in the sister art i will turn to a case in point which to my mind is both striking and familiar it is the resemblance of character between s and the poems of robert it is true the artist in this instance has confined himself to a mode of conveying his ideas so simple and that the comparison hardly holds good between tlie productions of the pencil and the pen all that i maintain is the of talent of tone of mind and moral feeling displayed in their separate works we find in both the same to nature without ornament or affectation and we discover the pathos in those slight touches of which genius alone is capable with the same of fancy lawless and describing as if in very scenes the most grotesque ludicrous or familiar ,7

soon but the girl settled that matter by saying that she had had enough of study for the present she would much rather she said remain and attend to the household affairs which would enable her mother to her visit east as much as she wished her parents came to the conclusion that it would be best to allow her to make her choice she had already a fair education and if she was content to remain at home it was undoubtedly better that she should do so had been giving some uneasiness to his father of late by the condition of his health he had become paler than usual and his appetite was he appeared to care for nothing but would lie for hours at a time in a with his eyes fixed on sometimes having to be called several times before he heard the person who him ascribed this state of affairs to his son s fondness for but assured himself that it would soon pass off ,5
if he were at last supported through the bitterness of parting from the dearest of earthly knew it could only be by the of divine mercy think of these things my beloved wife more than of me the cup of which we have together has been sweet as the waters of paradise remember from whence that cup was filled and believe that there are rivers of delight in store for those who faithfully their appointed task pictures of private life my last my parting is to pray fervently and to teach our child to pray by of this duty we suffer from the divine presence and then in our times of utmost need when we would return to this resource it seems as if a veil had dropped between us and heaven pray then dear even when the refreshing are upon thy path and there seems no immediate need for prayer made no answer but she pressed his hand as if to say my path must henceforth be through the desert and then her husband went on there is a strange fluttering at my heart and i feel that death is near tremble not i thee but raise my head and let me die where it was my happiness to live my poor boy i would not have him near me for he could not understand my situation and might learn to be afraid of death i have nothing to him but a father s blessing and a father s kiss thou shalt press it upon his cheek when i am gone â the last and the dearest and then his words became inarticulate and his breathing difficult but supported him to the very last and alone for to her it would have seemed like to call in the help of stranger hands and having no fear of death nor weak longing to escape from the presence of the dead she remained alone in the chamber through the solemn stillness of that hour which follows the mortal separation of soul and body while the room seems filled with the atmosphere of death and voices of beings are whispering tidings firom the land of spirits the first sound that startled her from that heavenly communion was the voice of her child in the garden below it became necessary to rouse herself and descending into her little parlour she caught up ber boy in her arms and for the first time burst into an agony of tears how solitary was that long night to the heart of the mother hour hour she spent in the chamber of the deceased watching that pale extended figure until the white bed clothes seemed to tremble beneath the intensity of her gaze and sometimes she started at a fancied heaving of the breast but faith and love were strong within her and sweeter to her was that silent than all which the busy world without could offer as the delights to count over every item of bis treasure so she recalled and dwelt upon each excellence of him whose lamp had so far as regards the things of this world left her m total darkness but as she knew that another morning would dawn and that the sun would return again that light would dance upon the hills and the voice of be heard in the so she trusted that the sun of would arise and shine upon the darkness of her soul and she trusted not in vain for oil was poured upon the troubled waters and her soul was filled as with an holy calm tell us ye sons of pleasure ye of how it is that you endure the of the desert without the aid of religion â without the consolation of prayer though bland forgot not for a single moment that the wheels of destruction had passed over her earthly hopes she remembered also that she was poor and that to the poor belong many duties which the children of and refinement think it inconsistent with the tenderness of wounded feelings to perform to every arrangement for household comfort she attended with her and ail things for the order and decency of the burial were of her without any of what was respectful and the day before the funeral arrived and had not yet taken her child into the sacred chamber she had herself been there since the first rising of the sun and the dew was yet upon the leaves she had gathered of and to place within the coffin and flowers to tlie room and now when her silent breakfast was over and she and the child and the one domestic had knelt own together to pray for the blessing o their heavenly father upon the transactions of another day she led her child up and raising him in her arms he rested vith his rosy fingers upon the side of the and looked upon the face of the dead he looked earnestly and long and then directed an glance to his if he asked of her an explanation of th strange mystery but he made no though he turned again and again as fascinated by the beauty of that still pale countenance from which every trace of anxiety and care had passed away it is true the hair retained its few silver threads but it rested on a brow as serenely beautiful as the surface of the summer ma when its waters sleep beneath a sky and make no ripple on the shore and the bright eyes were closed upon the world for ever not as in weariness or disgust but as iâ y to their inward vision was revealed a light compared with which all without was perfect darkness and the pure lips were closed from whence had flowed the e of feeling the force of truth and the inspiration of that wisdom which is from above little soon returned to his usual sports but many times during ,7

friends she had made there cost her no small pain yet if she had been going to she felt that her grief would have been still more keen for she would have been in that case leaving the dead as well as the living mrs tells me that you leave behind you many a at my dear said her aunt softly as they wound down the hill to the village yes yes sobbed every one at the hotel has been so kind but she was not thinking only of those at the hotel presently they passed cottage at the door of which stood both its tenants heads and every appearance of sympathy and respect mr i know by sight said miss as they passed by but who was that other young man who showed such great feeling it was a mr â mr stammered miss regarded her young companion thoughtfully for a few minutes and then said i fear you will find the castle very dull my dear after the life you have been accustomed to lead sees absolutely no company his yes by the bye that is what he prefers to be called â though it is not absolutely necessary â you would not mind making use of the term just once â when you first see him can always call him sir not not at all t a â t i castle s an i will tell you all about him presently but if you don t mind very much at your introduction to him it be a great point â a very great point indeed â if you would his castle if i don t mind it very much i am to kiss his hand was the thought that s mind as the carriage passed through the lodge gates â unlocked to receive them and closed and fastened directly they had entered â and drove through the broad avenue of oaks that led to castle who on earth then was this mr edward to whose household she was about to belong and what was the mystery in connection with him from the gossip at she had only learnt that he was a kind and charitable to the poor but always others to be his and that he lived in a sort of semi state though without seeing company of any kind her impression had been that he was an eccentric personage who having taken some unreasonable disgust to society made use of his great wealth to render him entirely independent of it she remembered the information which the had given about him on their arrival and it now to her mind that her father had on that occasion shown a considerable interest in the man s relation of the matter as though it had in some way concerned himself was it possible that he was aware that her mother s sister was living in the service of mr edward in that case she did not wonder at his for she well knew notwithstanding his openly expressed contempt for the he had a great deal of family pride and again who was this mr edward to whom a woman of culture and refinement as her aunt evidently was could play the housekeeper without as it seemed any sense of humiliation as she came in sight of the castle she saw the red flag on its tower which as she now remembered as though he were a royal personage the presence of its tenant for the moment her recent loss and the novel circumstances in which she had so suddenly and unexpectedly found herself were lost sight of in an curiosity as the carriage drove up at the foot of the broad stone steps that led to the entrance of the castle two in

in answer to s questioning glance who in ner simplicity and amazement was ij no means certain that it was not his himself this official conducted them into a noble hall the walls of which were hung with pictures with ancient weapons of all sorts in the centre of it as if to welcome them stood a short man in ordinary costume except that his fingers were laden with more rings than is usual with the masculine sex his brown hair which was thin and stuck closely to his and face like about a cream cheese and his whole appearance would have been as it was certainly but for a pair of brilliant brown eyes which by their and intelligence went far to redeem it for all that knew this again might have been the lord of the castle himself â it was like opening a present packed with after of paper each of which to the appears to be the final one â but her doubts on this point were once more by her companion who introduced the personage in question as mr his secretary it did not escape s natural quickness stimulated as it was by curiosity that her aunt s tone was stiff and moreover she noticed that her made no mention of her being her niece as miss s manner in other respects conveyed no sense of of rank on either side justly concluded that mr edward s housekeeper if such indeed was her aunt s position at the castle was not on friendly terms with mr edward s secretary mr hey ton s manner on the other handy was polite and even his voice was soft and low and he had a way of placing his white plump glistening hand on the region of his heart as he spoke that gave a sort of dramatic

had occurred to her to send the poem that gave her so much pleasure to dick it would make him think of her when he was far away it would tell him that she had not forgotten him the idea pleased her so much that it did not occur to her to think if she would be doing wrong in sending these verses to her and with renewed and happiness she continued her among her books there was no question in her mind as to which she would read and she anticipated hours of de a s wife light in tracing between herself and the lady who used to read and to her aristocratic lover she feared at first she had lost this novels but when it was discovered it was put aside for immediate use the next that came under her hand was the story of a country doctor in this instance the medical hero had poisoned one sister to whom he was secretly married in order that he might wed a second at first hesitated but remembering that there was an with a carriage in a muddy lane she decided upon looking it through again another book related the love of a young lady who found herself in the awkward of not being able to care for anyone but her groom who was lucky enough to be the possessor of the most wonderful violet eyes the fourth described the distressing position of a young clergyman who when he told the lady of his choice that his means for the moment did not admit of his taking a wife was answered that it did not matter for in the meantime she was quite willing to be his mistress this devotion and self sacrifice touched so deeply that she was forced to pause in her search to consider how those who have loved much are forgiven but at this moment mrs â de entered oh what are you doing although the question was asked in an of voice affecting to be one of astonishment only there was nevertheless in it an accent of reproof that was especially to in her present mood a deaf anger against her mother in law s interference oppressed ber but getting the better of it she said quietly though somewhat sullenly you always want to know what i m doing i declare one can t turn round but you re after me just like a shadow a s wife what you say is unjust replied the old woman warmly i m sure i never after you well anyhow there it is i m looking out for a book to read in the evenings if you want to know i thought you d ven up reading those vain and sinful books they can t do you any good what harm can they do me they turn your thoughts from christ i ve looked into them to see that i may not be speaking and i ve found them nothing but vain accounts of the world and its i didn t read far but what i saw was a lot of of women who couldn t love their husbands and much sighing after riches and pleasure i thanked god you d given over such things i believed your heart was turned towards him now it me bitterly to see i was mistaken i don t know what you mean never said that there was any harm in my reading tales ah i m afraid has never set a good i wouldn t blame him for he s my own son but i d wish to see him not so highly the things of the world we must live though answered quite understanding what she said live â of course we have to live but it depends how we live and what we live for â whether it be to indulge the desires of the flesh the desire of the eye or to regain the image of god to have the design of god again planted in oar souls this is what we should for and it is only thus that we shall find true happiness though these were memories of phrases heard in the pulpit they were uttered by mrs with a with a of belief that took from them any ap of and did not notice that a s wife her mother in law was using words that were not habitual to her but what do you want me to do said who began to feel frightened to go to christ to love him he is all we have to help us and they who love him truly are guided as to how to live whether we eat or drink or whatever we do it springs from or leads to the love of god and man these words stirred to her very a sudden of feeling brought the tears to her eyes and she was on the point of throwing herself into mrs s arms the temptation to have a good cry was almost irresistible and the burden of her pent up emotions was more than she could bear but the while rapidly within herself she hesitated until an unexpected turn of thought harshly put it before her that she was being made a fool of â that she had a perfect right to look through her books and poetry and that s were no more than she deserved for allowing a mother in law to bully her then the tears of sorrow became those of anger and striving to speak as rudely as she could she said i don t talk about christ as much as you but he judges us by our hearts and not by our words you would do well to humble yourself before you come to preach to others dear it s because i see you interested in things that have no concern with god s love that i speak to ,3

s door closed behind them her arm round s waist and led the way to her here my darling my precious sit down and let me look at you and rejoice at having found you again i feel i have not half greeted yoa as i ought oh the comfort you would have been to me during these past months i you would have built up my resolutions and made me think as i do now without the bitter anguish and regret of past experiences exclaimed she flinging her arms round s do not speak so bitterly my own your past experiences as you call them will probably be of more permanent benefit to you than all the advice either i or all the world could give this pale brow tells me though that you have suffered more than your letters expressed replied fondly returning her friend s suffered i suffering is too feeble a word to express all i have endured and still endure do you not remember our conversation on my wedding day the anguish i anticipated has been realized yes more than realized and your remains yet exclaimed she passionately but how is this i remarked to day with the utmost joy the excellent outward understanding between yourself and lord surely surely my darling you are not suffering the false pride which you before your marriage still to shadow your happiness i exclaimed in a voice of consternation â our present position â what can i it to i will tell you it is a fair outside devoid of inward substance a nut without a a state false unnatural hollow a semblance of reality which the first and mo t fragile obstacle would like before the wind but continued she after a pause of a second do not

latter words if all were as hollow as you represent i am firmly persuaded that the earl never would have made you his wife nothing shall ever convince me that he has not truth and reality on his side

life will not be so stormy a one as mine should you become sir s wife your prudent firmness will save you from the on which my happiness has been wrecked you also have another aid denied to me for sir s character is more open more easily read and learned than lord s â now i am come to visit you you must positively not encourage any such hopes until sir gives me some sign of preference than mere admiration i do not let my mind dwell on what i feel would be too great happiness for me to expect sir g s wife ought to be a person of much higher consequence than myself and it would not be a sign of the great wisdom you are pleased to attribute to me to cherish thoughts which grow only to sting the imagination that gave them birth replied with a quiet well we won t discuss sir more at present only i will ve you this piece of information that we expect him here with lady next week now look round not one word of admiration have i received as yet for my bower t is a shrine fit for a i will that do replied rising and with her arm linked within her friend s she wandered round the exquisite little apartment scarcely replied i expect your admiration will be far more to morrow morning when

innumerable gifts â well i shall not give to this assertion of yours until my own eyes have witnessed its truth do you know you strongly remind me of the child in the old story book who trembled and dared not for a long time put out his hand and boldly seize his cake because it was stuck with and made to look formidable like a now in my opinion had you courage to with these terrible difficulties

approaching a small stand on which lay a large volume beautifully bound in closed with a small gold in the shape of a heart studded with precious stones this book has been my great consolation in my

nothing answered looking him in the face and smiling but we have come many times before to this gray rock and we have talked very softly among the of the trees they were pleasant hours i love to make

the indians set out on their grand fall hunt too lazy to go into the recesses of the mountains away from they wait for the deer to come out and then them this plan also has the advantage of finding them in bands great preparations are made old guns are mended bullets and the hunters wash themselves and fast to some extent to good luck as they say men and women old and young set forth together

more painful for the blow was aimed at men not in a situation to defend themselves the one sinking under the weight of his own glory a sacrifice offered up by accustomed to victory and forgetful of

could no longer make a reply silent and indignant it under the gathered t the in the at at the and in the campaign in france of if so many glorious recollections could not gain forgiveness for his

proceeds less hastily than passion and not her judgments as policy at once timid and her and state the other general thrown by evil times at a distance from a country to which he has constantly done honour by his courage and virtues covered with numerous wounds which his generous heart had hoped to use in favour of the dragged also before the and defended like another by filial piety could not

orders after the victory of to pursue the and not to lose sight of them and to preserve a communication with the centre of the army we cannot refuse to read with the greatest interest the new details which the count de on this subject a bosom with so many wounds received during five and twenty years of fighting gives to this officer the right to justify himself and on the friends of their country the duty of hearing him c c from the general s work has produced a great sensation because the place in which it was written gave it an appearance of that no one thought of doubting we see nevertheless with pain that the author has attributed the of the th of june to two who seemed protected in public t opinion as much by their misfortunes as by their services it ignorance of the french character to endeavour to disgrace and general when one was dead and the other a relation of thought it incumbent to answer the attack directed against this unfortunate commander it was useless public opinion has sufficiently him every one knew that at as well as elsewhere he displayed all the resources of his courage and this conviction has not rendered the tears less bitter that were shed on the tomb of this noble victim general has received the same justice from his countrymen no one thought him responsible for the that attended our arms they saw with sorrow his exile from a country he had honoured and the voices which demand his return have more than once in another afforded a solace to his heart nevertheless his feelings have been wounded by the thought that his fellow citizens on the faith of some slight could attribute to him the greatest disaster that ever happened to france he has endeavoured to the facts that have it to him and his son a worthy has published the observations this his justification so interesting in itself becomes still more so since it is presented to the public under the double recommendation of exile and filial piety the observations of general have been read with not that we looked for his justification for no one accused him but there was a melancholy pleasure in this terrible drama and in following the divers chances with more interest and anxiety than if the result was not already known that napoleon committed a great fault in dividing his army and in sending to a distance a corps so considerable as that of general cannot be disputed and we will easily that this first fault was the cause of others we must give credit to general who in guarding his reputation and in the necessity of answering unjust attacks has not been carried beyond the bounds of moderation in regard to a misfortune still greater than his own general s work contains much precious matter for history and it may even at the present day afford ample subject for reflection to military men what is most important to a great number of readers is that in the catastrophe which forms its subject the honour of the french army remained and heaven be praised this fact appears in every sâ age as to general his claims are known his life speaks or him the interest that his the regrets that accompany him in his exile are the most honourable testimony that a citizen can receive the day is not afar off when justice will triumph when general will be restored to the embraces of his family and te the sight of his countrymen c and iv â ir of the lives of and

moved to add a that slavery should never exist in the territory thus acquired this was known as the the was finally rejected but it opened the question of freedom or slavery in the new region before the war was ended and the agitation thus introduced once more into politics did not cease while slavery existed the first effect of the excitement was to render certain the defeat of the party in the

i am afraid my room will seem to you very i have read of s but the bare simplicity of the room did not her it seemed to her more natural to sleep in a low narrow bed like this than in fine linen and down and she liked the scant bleak furniture the two chairs the iron wash hand stand and the window with a bit of india muslin they stood talking hardly knowing what they were saying her eyes embarrassed him and she stopped in the middle of a sentence now she said turning towards the door i want you to take me to lunch we ll go to the he had to admit he had not sufficient money three shillings and sixpence were what remained until he received the from one of his newspapers but i am not going to have you pay for my lunch i am asking you be nice don t refuse what does it matter what does money matter to me it comes in so fast that i don t know what to do with it by it was at the end of the season and there were not many people in the low dining room all the knew and she was conducted to a table and as she passed up the room she wondered what was being thought of he was so different from the exquisite elegance of the man she was usually seen with he was strange looking but was as distinguished as only the distinction was of another kind he always remembered how at the end of lunch she took out her gold purse and emptied its contents on the and he was astonished at the with which she spent money in every shop that caught her fancy the afternoon included a visit to the s where she had to make inquiries about bits and she called at two where she had left things to be mended she ordered a dozen pair of boots and purchased a large quantity of after a long discussion about dies and and when all this was finished she proposed they should have tea in gardens knew very little of london he knew victoria station for he took the train there to the strand for he went there to see and because he lived there but he had never been to the park and seemed puzzled when spoke of the and the round pond it was surprising he said to find forest groves in the heart of london they had tea at a little table set beneath huge branches and after tea they sat on a sloping lawn facing the long water she wondered if he were aware of the beauty of things the wonder of life the blue of the sky the romance of the clouds but she was bent on hearing of the invisible world apparently always so visible to him and she tried to win his thoughts away from the park and to lead him to speak of his visions she did not know if she believed in them but she for exaltation for an of the terror in which had tied her and in this mood s dreams floated up in her life like clouds in a sky he sat talking lost in his dreams and she sat listening like one enchanted now their talk had strayed from the descriptions of visions beheld by folk by ic who lived in back in squares to the philosophy of his own belief and she smiled for delight at seeing the in him the ancient had survived in him and it seemed natural and even right that he should believe that after death men pass to the great plain of the land over the sea the land of the children of men lived there he said for a while enjoying all their desires and at the end of this period they are bom again man lives between two desires â his desire of spiritual peace and happiness and his desire of earthly experience oh how true that man s desire of earthly experience continued draws him to re birth and he is bom into a form that fits his nature as a glove fits a hand the soul of a warrior passes into the robust form of a warrior the soul of a i into the most sensitive body of a poet so you see how modem science has only robbed the of their beauty he spoke of the old irish legend of and the bard and begged of him to tell it her he said had been fin two hundred years before when he was fin he had been present at the death of a certain king the bard was singing before and mis stated the place of the king s death corrected him and the bard was so at the that he to the kingdom so that it should become barren and he would only agree to withhold his terrible satire if would give him his wife mrs yes just so replied laughing asked for three days delay to consider the dreadful in which the bard s threat had placed him and during that time sat with his wife her saying a man will come to us his feet are already upon the western sea and at the time when the bard stood up to claim the wife a strange warrior came into the holding a spear he said that he was one of fin s famous warriors that the king whose place of death was in dispute was killed where had said that if they dug down into the earth they would find the spear head that it would fit the shaft he held by in his hand that it was the spear head that had killed the king go on and tell me some more stories i love to listen to you â you are better than any play and ,3

his rooms well i hear the missing one is found he said as the came in yes she is with her father but the peculiar thing is that she her lips absolutely about her absence she not only refuses to speak now but that her refusal is final mr hesitated what card to play when does the marriage take place he asked finally with me never i have been thrown over unless she had explained i could not have married her any way could i the critic said he did not know it would certainly have been awkward and what is your theory he added do you still lay anything to no i am completely but never mind it is over stretched himself and yawned do you know i almost doubt if i have really been in love at all i feel a queer sense of relief at being out of it though there is a dull pain too that isn t exactly comfortable i told coming in that she should have married him upon my soul i wish she would she s an awful nice little thing and he has a heart that is genuine enough for her well it s odd anyway astonishment was written on the face of the other gentleman as he heard these statements you hare at least gained one point he said im a black you have done the best part of the greatest novel that ever was written sit down as soon as you can and finish it and we shall see your name so high up on the temple of fame that no contemporary of this generation can reach it so high the letters will be i fear responded with a laugh where do you think i can get the supper in new york i am positively starved i don t believe i ve eaten a thing since yesterday if you can help me any to clear the board let us go together this invitation was accepted and began making a more particular toilet taking great pains with the set of his and spending at least ten minutes extra on his hair when he had finished himself he never had allowed a to touch his face you won t lose any time on the novel will you asked anxiously while these preparations were in progress you must take hold of it while the events are fresh in your mind all right i ll begin again to morrow morning and stick to the work till it s done where shall we go to supper i ll tell you s the critic could not conceal his surprise at the that had taken place so suddenly in the young man s conduct he stared at him with a look that approached consternation you want to go there he exclaimed unable to control himself you wish to dine with some pretty girl eh t start violently an no no not yet he answered we can get a supper room without that i wish to be among men as mean as myself i want to dine in a house full of people who would cut a woman s throat or break her heart and sleep soundly when they had done it i chapter xxv an secret the did not stay much longer at crushed by their misfortunes neither cared to remain near the scenes that had made them so unhappy nor where they would be likely to meet faces which kept alive their grief the father knew no more than at first concerning the strange conduct of his daughter she had told him nothing and he had not asked her a single question it was enough for him that she was bowed with a great trouble his only thought was to her distress in every possible way he was old how old he had not realized until that week when she changed from a happy laughing girl standing at the threshold of a marriage she longed for to a sombre shadow that walked silently by his side he was the one who under ordinary circumstances should have received the care and the but everything was altered now he guided and directed the younger feet even though his own were faltering and slow a b where they had gone no one seemed to know received one brief note from mr thanking him again in touching phrase for his many and saying that wished to add her most earnest wish for his happiness the letter said they were going away for some time but no more he went one day to hoping to learn something from the servants and found the home entirely deserted a neighbor told him a real estate agent near by had the keys but that the place was neither for sale nor to rent the agent when found could add nothing to his stock of information mr had merely mentioned that he was going on a journey and asked to have a man sleep at the house during his absence as a precaution against robbery mr saw two or three times but the were so unsatisfactory that he felt them not worth repeating the told him as he had told that he did not believe he had ever really loved and was actually relieved now that the strain was ended no persuasion could turn him from this statement which he made rather in explanation of his present course than as a of it had persuaded him that a love affair was necessary to develop his talents as a writer before he knew what he was about such an affair had been upon him he had felt its pleasures and pains to the and now it was ended all that was left as a result was a pile of which the critic pronounced wonderful it was as if he had been in a trance or secret henceforth he would confine his writings to or to poetic ,5
opinion of certain folk to whom it seems hard that they should not pray much oftener for themselves believe me that no prayer is better or more profitable than that of which i am speaking perhaps you fear that it will not go to the pains which you will suffer in i answer that such prayer is too holy and too pleasing to god to be useless even if the time of your should be a little longer â well let it be so oh to be good like that she thought and her soul raised its eyes in a little shy a few pages further on she read â that all may take heed for neglect of this counsel a may find herself in an from which she may not find strength to free herself and then great god what what this friendship may not be the source it is impossible to say what number none but an eye witness may believe they are but trifles and i see no reason for them here i merely add in it is f it is an evil in a superior it is a plague spot an excellent remedy is to be together only at those times by the rule on other occasions to refrain from speech as is now our custom and to live separately each in her cell as the and although it be a custom to unite for work in a community room i desire that the of the of st joseph shall be freed from this custom for it is much easier to keep silence if each works in her cell moreover it is of the first importance to to solitude in order to advance in prayer and as prayer should be the mortar of this we cherish all that which the spirit in us glancing down the pages her eyes were arrested by a passage of even more subtle more penetrating by would you know a certain sign my daughters by which you may judge of your progress in virtue let each one look within herself and discover if she believes herself to be the of you all and if for the benefit of the others she makes it visible by her actions that she really thinks that this is so that is the certain sign of spiritual advancement and not delight in prayer nor nor visions and such like which god to souls when he is so pleased we shall only know the value of such in the next world it is not so with humility â humility is a money which is always current it is safely invested capital a perpetual income but extraordinary are money which is lent for a time and may at any moment be called in i repeat our true treasure is profound humility great mortification and an obedience which seeing god in the superior to his every order the saint s delicate yet perception and her power of expressing the shadowy and filled with admiration and the saint appeared to her in the light of a great she wondered if had ever read these pages â the best remedy in my opinion that a can employ to conquer the imperfect affection which she still bears her parents is to from seeing them until by patient prayer she has obtained from god the freedom of her soul when she is so disposed that their visits is a cross let her see them by all means for then she will bring good to their souls and do no harm to her own this seemed not a little grim but how touching is the personal confession which appears on the following page my parents loved me extremely according to what they said and i loved them in a way that did not allow them to forget me nevertheless i have seen from what has happened to me and what has happened to other how little we may count upon their affection for us the of such conduct seemed open to doubt s by ic s but is a word that none may speak without calling into question the entire conduct of his or her life remembered that she had left her father for the sake of her and that she had refused to marry because marriage especially marriage with did not seem with her soul s safety looked at from a certain side her life did seem self but allowance she thought must be made for the difficulties â the in which the first false step had her but in any case she must not question the of prayer that was a of the church the mission of the orders is to pray for those who do not pray for themselves and if we believe in the of prayer we need not scruple to leave our parents to live in a where by our prayers we help them to eternal salvation we leave them for a little while but only that we may live with them for ever believe me my dear sisters if you serve him well you will not find better parents than those the divine master sends you i know that it is even so what beauty there is in her thought i repeat that those whose is toward worldly things and who do not make progress in virtue shall leave this should she persist in remaining a mm let her enter another for if she doesn t she will see what will happen to her or must she complain about me nor accuse me of not having made known to her the practical life of the i founded if there is an earthly paradise it is in this house but only for souls who desire nothing but to please ood who have no thought for themselves for these the life here is infinitely agreeable this passage is one of the very few in which appears the wise practical woman ,3

that the nearer approach of the boat might inform him with more certainty whether her course lay towards the town nothing however was gained by these visits no boat came in view and the gloom forbade

look out the small craft which on the previous evening he had noted standing across the river it was a suspicious sight to see a boat at such a time in such a place and connecting it with the circumstances his wife had remarked in the night found reason enough to put himself on the watch for the person who controlled its motions he accordingly went into his hut and sticking under his a s pistol which he kept for domestic defence and taking a stout white oak staff in his hand he forth along the margin of the river resolved to plant himself in some advantageous position whence he might

tendency of the age he had gone astray from the firm foundation of an faith and wandered into a cloud region where every thing was misty and ever mocking him with a semblance of reality but when he flung himself upon it for sup from an old port and rest his and early training demanded something steadfast but looking forward he beheld piled on and behind him an gulf between the man of yesterday

purchase by which the united states was to pay fifteen million dollars when the treaty was concluded the all rose and said we have lived long and this is the fairest work of our lives the treaty we have just signed will a vast wilderness into a flourishing country from this day the united states becomes a first class power the articles we have signed will produce no tears but ages o happiness for countless human beings by this purchase the country acquired more territory than all she had before possessed and there was opened to her the prospect of becoming one of the greatest nations on the earth french included in whole or in part the states of and the of and the indian territory â that is to say there are at present twelve very large states and almost wholly made from as bought from france in before the purchase of there had been some dissatisfaction in the western country and a few restless characters had labored to further a project for separating the interior country from the eastern states which seemed remote in that day of slow and tedious traffic by horse paths through the mountains after the the french inhabitants the treason of pâ â p â i â o s â n a t of new and the region about it were not well pleased that they had been transferred to the united states without their own consent spain at that time held and was in a state of to the united states the people of

against his d own part in to snatch the from whom he had supported the would have nothing to do with him the hoping to succeed by the aid of s him for governor of new york but alexander the great leader of the would not support a man so mischievous as and he procured his defeat in revenge fought a with and killed him this made more than ever detested and he now embarked in a dark scheme to seize territory from the in history of the united states and probably to and perhaps all of the western states from the united states and so to play the small napoleon on the american continent he soldiers and procured arms and started flat boats loaded with these down the and the but his plot was discovered and he was tried for treason but he could not be convicted for want of sufficient evidence he spent most of his remaining years in poverty and popular neglect and died at an advanced age chapter beginning of the second war with england the war between during s administration the english and france ment was involved in a long war with napoleon who had made himself emperor of the french and had conquered a great part of western europe he was perhaps the greatest military genius of modern times and it seemed that nothing could withstand his armies but great britain being an island was protected by the intervening channel from the advance of napoleon s troops england moreover remained in possession of the sea as the greatest power in the world of english naval were allowed to impress from british merchant ships â that is to force them to serve in ships of war â and in this struggle with napoleon they found themselves in great need of but england had also long claimed the right to impress her the second with england own subjects when found on ships of other nations many english sailors sought employment in american ships and every man born in great britain who sailed before the mast in an american vessel was liable to be seized by an english man of war as english naval officers were allowed to judge whether a man was a native of their country or not thousands of natives of america were impressed on british ships it was very to americans to have their ships stopped on the high seas and searched and their citizens forced to serve in the navy of a foreign power american hated this system and one poor fellow when ordered to get his clothes and come on board an english man of war went below and off his left hand and came on deck with the bleeding stump on which the officer left without him but england was all powerful on the sea and the united states had to bear with such or give up sailing ships during this war between england and france which with the whole civilized world our country tried to be but england wished to interrupt our trade with the countries under control of france while issued orders to check our trade with england the successive which these two powers issued one after another became so severe at last that our ships could not sail to any port without the greatest danger of being seized by the of one or the other nation as the english were much stronger at sea than the french they did us the more harm if our country had been strong it would not have the of borne these so long but it was then but a small nation and far from being prepared for a war with history of the united states land president was very anxious to avoid war and to go on paying off the debt of the country which was his leading purpose the president thought that the united might get the offensive by stopping all its trade with the outside world

to select ill and that if they do theirs is the crime and the shame and theirs should be the life long penalty if a directly or demands marriage and divorce his laws will fail of their effect in his demands then he should have special reference to the powers to be at the disposal of those of whom these demands are made it nothing to say that a thing ought to be if as a general rule it cannot be but of all the most â even when mature thought has brought wisdom and when age has conferred experience â is the decision whether a being loved now is the one of all others morally physically to whom in a true home we can impart permanent happiness and from whom we are capable of receiving it mortal eyes even the wisest never fully the veil there may be that beyond which no foresight could anticipate and if such be the case with wisdom and experience to guide what shall we expect from faith just entering a false world serenely ignorant of its an utter stranger to its will its goodness be its protection the reverse in such a trial it is the noblest who are the most exposed the better the nature the more imminent the danger it the cold the heartless the calculating have fair chance of escape it is the warm the trusting the generous who are the usual what belief so blind as that of first pure young affection what so easily cheated as a fresh and faithful and innocent heart and by what right according to what principle i pray you do we decide that there is one mistake that is never to be corrected one error the most fatal of au which once committed we shall never be permitted to repair a life long penalty you would inflict and for what offence say that an honest mistake were a crime say that a error were a career of shame even then the sentiment would be not christian an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth was the rule addressed to the hard hearts nowhere in au christ s will you find the like the sin of your brother seven times you would not forgive yet as a christian you ought to forgive it even to seventy times seventy the entrance to the father s house you would bar against the returning prodigal his you would declare to him was the sin the shame his should be the life long penalty no rejoicing that he was dead and is alive again no weeping joy that he was lost and is found let us dismiss and stand face to face with the realities of life the time may come when men and women the of the affections opened shall distinguish and choose their own appropriate mates i have heard argue that it will and that there is a future before mankind even on earth in which separation and divorce will be unknown terms god send it but meanwhile it is with the present and its errors and its evils and its sufferings and its temptations to sin that we have to deal where we fail to cure it is our duty to if we cannot make au the married virtuous and happy let us do what we can by humane laws of to relieve from situations and thus to domestic misery and arrest household vice i thank you my dear sir for the opportunity afforded to discuss this subject and am faithfully yours tuesday march mr s to robert â dear sir as you have intimated your thai our discussion should here close i will endeavor to introduce no new views into this letter i will simply sum up the as it stands l i have hitherto shown and you have not attempted to from the of april marriage and divorce that marriage is according to every dictionary a union far life at the pleasure of those married or either of them i have insisted that you have no right to this important word in a different sense from that given to it by the great what you favor may be ever so much better than marriage though i believe it far otherwise but it is not the same thing and you ought to give it a name when i am told that two persons are married i understand that they have to live together as husband and wife not during pleasure but during life the the christian religion the general consent of my and of the civilized world fully justify me in that conception when therefore you apply the term marriage to a very different compact you not merely use words but you confess the of your cause the who another s trade marks the inferiority of h s own wares i protest then against your using the word marriage to any other union than one for life if a and b have agreed with ever so much ceremony to live as man and wife until one or both of them shall see fit to separate and form new relations they may be ever so wisely and but they are not married i made this point as strongly before our readers wiu judge whether you have or have not met it at all events i mind the s to hold fast the form of sound we who stand by marriage as christ established and de it have a right to the word by which that relation has ever been what you advocate is quite another thing â be pleased to give it a name then if we call compact by your name the public will understand that we admit your union to be more rational honorable than ours at all events we warn you off our premises and insist that you shall not lay your eggs in our nest if you demand liberty ,8

thus puts an example â if two animals one of a black colour and the other white be placed in a higher temperature than that of their own body the heat will enter the one that is black with the greatest rapidity and its temperature considerably above the other but when these animals are placed in a situation the temperature of which is considerably lower than their own the black animal will give out its heat by to every surrounding object colder than itself and speedily have its temperature reduced while the white animal will part its heat by at a much slower rate i the though not so

down his commission and appear at rome to answer a criminal but he saw that a few days more of service would deliver his country from the and therefore neither indignant at his country s ingratitude

self command continued her conversation in a low tone with mr though the increased bloom on her cheek showed that she was not quite so insensible as she wished to ear a feeling of intense irritation arose in s breast as she noted the little anxiety manifested by the earl who presently turned altogether aside from her to address the lady after some little time devoted to paying his respects to lady ton and for his unexpected presence in his usual off hand style colonel came up to lady and apparently encouraged by the warmth of her greeting took a seat by her side while presently arose and walked away in direction of the house with her friend lady sir immediately sauntered off also while had the satisfaction to see the earl interrupt his discourse with lady and for a few brief moments his attention upon herself and her heart with pleasure as she fancied she detected a slight uneasiness and dissatisfaction in his manner when he withdrew his glance her spirits rose and the beautiful color sparkled in her as she listened and responded to the flattery my dear lady what can possess your lord to day i never saw his w before with such dark majesty upon honor one would suppose he was

isle of where she will spend days in private with her family i presume the aristocracy will generally follow her example so far as the exhibition is concerned leaving it to the poorer class to whom five shillings is a consideration absurd speculations are as to what the mob will do in a building â whether they will it quietly and promptly at i â whether there will not be a rush made at the diamonds and other precious stones by bands of thieves secretly for plunder c c i do not remember that like apprehensions were ever entertained in our country but faith in man is weak here while faith in the police the horse guards and the is strong â there are always two hundred soldiers and three hundred in the building while it is open to the public and in case of any attempt at robbery every

down a few of the notes on london i have made since the sailing of the last westminster abbey i attended divine worship in this celebrated edifice la t sunday morning situated near the houses ot j v glances at europe ment the royal palaces of and st james and in the most aristocratic quarter of the city its external appearance is less imposing than i had expected and what i saw of its interior did not particularly impress me lofty stained windows and a profusion of carving and all manner of costly for absorbing money and labor made on me the im of waste rather than taste seeming to give form and substance to the orator s of the of the without her inspiration a acquaintance with the edifice or with the principles of architecture might serve to correct this hasty judgment but surely westminster abbey ought to afford a place of worship equal in capacity fitness and convenience to a modern church edifice and surely it does not i think there is no one of the ten best churches in new york which is not superior to the abbey for this purpose i supposed myself acquainted with all the approved of the morning service but when the clergyman who at the abbey began to out dearly beloved brethren c in a semi chant i was taken completely it sounded as though some had himself into the desk and was under the of reading the service to aâ as possible the alleged peculiarity of pulpit upon the regular yankee as the service proceeded i became more accustomed and more reconciled to this mode of utterance but never enough so to like it nor even the which were given in the same way but much better after i came away i was informed that this semi chant is termed and is said to be a revival of an ancient method of rendering the church service if such be the fact i can only say that in my poor judgment that revival was an unwise and unfortunate one the service was very long â more than two hours â the music excellent â the congregation large â the sermon so far as i could judge had nothing bad in it yet there was an century air about the whole which strengthened my conviction that the church will very soon be summoned to take her stand distinctly oâ the side either of or of and that the summons will shake not the church only but the realm to its centre schools in the evening i attended the ragged school situated in s field lane near the cattle market in where was burned at the stake by as had been burned by before him the honest candid history of persecution for faith s sake has never yet been written whenever it shall be it must cause many ears to it was something past o clock when we reached the rough old building in a filthy poverty stricken quarter which has been rudely fitted up for the ragged school â one of the first i believe that was attempted i should say there were about four hundred pupils on its benches with about forty te the pupils were at least from five to twenty years old with a dozen or more the were a hundred or so mainly from three to ten years of age but in a separate and upper apartment ascending out of the main room there were some forty women with teachers exclusively of their own sex the teachers were of various of capacity but as all teach without pay and under circumstances which forbid the idea of any other than or religious ,8
sum of money i had expended upon my lost friend in vain i attempted to i could not find one word to express my sense of the cruelty of denying me this last poor consolation the money was placed in my hand and i grasped it unconsciously without once glancing at the sum while he went on at the need i might one day feel of that which i bestowed too his words conveyed no meaning to my ear at the time i only felt that he spoke but after circumstances convinced me that he was acting the friendly part of preparing me for a calamity which he had good cause to apprehend this short communication over we fell again into our former silence i wept but my tears were not all for tlie departed and in this manner the journey was completed weary and leaning on an arm that supported me because i was a necessary burden i reached my father s door the night was far advanced but all seemed bustle and within have you had company i asked no was the ready reply of my cousin jane accompanied with a look of meaning which exhausted as i was i longed to understand more than usual in her attentions she followed me to my own chamber where my sister was waiting to receive me and her embrace being also more warm than usual i felt certain that some influence was at work with which i was some secret spring of excitement had evidently been opened â of excitement that was not altogether joy for there were traces of recent tears which when i asked for my father flowed afresh what is the matter v said i what can have happened amongst you i see both smiles and tears tell that i may share in one or both the mystery was soon my father s affairs had for some time been advancing towards a crisis had made this discovery and unable to or assist him had done what he could in the way of his burdens by offering his hand to my sister for whom he had lately entertained the highest admiration this intelligence was to me and the latter part of it as if i were altogether and would of rejoice in my sister s good fortune for the death of s uncle added to his own continued of conduct rendered the match in every way desirable did i rejoice ask those who have from the cradle to the grave to their hearts of selfishness to themselves to torture and to five only on the happiness of others ask whether the natural glow of human feeling is ever totally extinguished â and you will be able to imagine whether i could rejoice adding to the intelligence i thought already that in anticipation of the sudden winding ip of my affairs it had been concluded to fix the day for my sister s marriage i was left alone with many kind wishes that i might sleep well and arise refreshed from the of my journey the vulgar that misfortunes never come singly has often given rise to in my heart that thus we are spared a degree of suffering which might otherwise be intolerable it is impossible to feel with equal two at once and consequently while two strokes fell upon me i endured only the agony of one the wedding day passed over as such things usually do my father appeared at j the pains op pleasing breakfast in the morning hurried over his part of the ceremony and turned when he felt that eyes were upon him my dresses had been prepared for and i acted my part without any clear perception of what was passing i was to accompany my sister as her bride s maid and when i begged to be allowed to remain with my father was told that my aunt and cousin were more fitting helps and that my duty was to support my sister and sustain her spirits and who is to support me t said i in the bitterness of my heart but i neither resisted nor complained and the party set off the newspapers said in high glee for a tour on the continent chapter viii during my six months residence on the continent dark passages in the annals of our family occurred the alteration in my father s circumstances the falling away of trusted friends and the thrown upon his name were which he met with apparent fortitude but at the ex of his life beneath the skies of italy this melancholy event was communicated to his children who were then too distant to return with any hope of being able to perform the last sad duties of nor was it until wearied with our continental and wishing for more settled habits that we bid adieu to the shores of france and sailed for our native country where a home supplied with all the comforts and with many of the of life was prepared for our reception â a home that was no home to me for there is something in dependence upon others in being an useless attachment to a family of which you are not by right a member which drives the heart out of doors however comfortably the person may be provided during the season of visiting and receiving visitors i was however very much at ease on the score of usefulness for the entertainment of guests was decidedly my sphere of excellence my sister felt this and valued me accordingly for whenever i forgot my duty grew silent and fell back by a n transition of thought into the aching void of my own bosom i was stirred up and requested to be more entertaining until my situation sometimes reminded me of that of the of the when out and made to roar and play tricks for the of the mob my powers of pleasing ,7

so fast that i had time enough to spare for a four days run into ireland which i was over persuaded to take by my companion the isle received us with extended arms if anything the of the appeared to be still warmer and more than elsewhere and the settlement of their a mere form that we were at liberty to go through or not as we preferred the went so far on more than one occasion as to kiss and to me their jewel the stood on their heads to do us honour and the very beggars about the regarded us with a solicitude that was the more remarkable by reason of the difference of our countries and upon the nineteenth day i returned like a punctual an exceedingly cheap tour shepherd to my flock and on our road tom esq at law insisted upon my the accounts of our expenses which â particularly as he handed me a much larger balance than under the circumstances i should have thought possible â i was very unwilling to do my share of the three weeks tour of coach railway and packet was under a five pound note well my dear fellow said i with that feeling of grateful admiration which a rarely himself to entertain except towards a great all i can say is i can t imagine how you did it i never lived better or at less cost in all my life and i shall certainly go over the same ground next and as i most sincerely hope with the same companion there was a curious expression about s eye which made me uneasy as he replied with some well i think your reverence had better not do that for a few seasons why why not â for goodness sake tell me why not said i getting alarmed oh nothing don t be afraid my dear sir trust me for keeping on the safe side of the law in these matters the law gasped i looking at the figures just transferred to my note book and somehow that they did not make up a larger sum why you don t mean to say you no i did nothing interrupted tom it was all you you and that note book the fact is you made such copious remarks in it from the first hour we started and at every place you came to that i thought you were a guide to the north and without asking you the question an exceedingly cheap tour which i considered would have been i communicated my suspicions sometimes in writing sometimes to the my friend i said to them is desirous of every information about this spot and particularly regarding your hotel charges you must not speak to him as if you were aware of this for he is pledged by the messrs to and independence but i am pleased with your house myself and am willing under the rose to do you a good turn every time you put pen to paper in the coffee room saved us apiece at least there was quite a difficulty in some places in getting them to charge us anything at all and i must say that all along you acted your part to perfection acted my part how dare you said i in a towering passion you base horrid there now you are going on to what is interrupted tom you never know when to stop and you are besides the last people in the world tp take a healthy and charitable view of things this is how the matter stands we have passed by your own confession a very three weeks we have given opportunities to a much class of our fellow countrymen to exhibit their and civility we have threatened to inflict upon society a new guide book which you have both the power and the will to withhold and finally we have had i must say an exceedingly cheap tour the gentle reader written a good deal for the general public without receiving any acknowledgment from that particular member of it the gentle reader i for one am not going to flatter him any longer it is my private belief that he never purchased a book in his life i doubt whether he ever even went so far as to to a library i believe him to be a sort of person who volumes from the book shelves of his friends and writes in pencil his remarks upon the of them it is exceedingly improbable if he does buy books that he ever bought any of mine because in plain truth the gentle reader is a fool otherwise would authors who are conscious of having been stupid and or of being about to become so in their next chapter so appeal to his and foolish forbearance they take such liberties with him and place him in such positions as would be resented by any person of proper sense and feeling when a love scene is about to be described at any intolerable the gentle reader is commonly in as a third party and made a of whether he will or no by the two silly young folks i the gentle it is first of all that he the gentle knows all about it being as he is so fascinating an individual and having been the object of adoration of so many hearts and then the whole tedious matter is laid before him in all its dove monotony while the melancholy details are dwelt upon with a sentimental distinctness to which itself would be almost in descriptions of scenery especially this patron of the has to go through a very great deal for their sweet he has to accompany them if he will be so good to inaccessible heights where the foot of man has never before trodden and where the shriek of the or other bird unknown except to alone is heard ,12
had come to see joseph at the counting house yesterday joseph had taken them out into the yard and they had talked together but it was not of the of salt fish they had spoken but of the of the sabbath dan had listened pen in hand his thoughts suspended and had heard them devote many minutes to the question â whether a man should dip himself in the nearest brook if he had accidentally touched a pig he had heard them i discuss at length the grace that should be used before eating j fruit from a tree and whether it were necessary to say three graces after eating three kinds of fruit at one meal he the brook had heard one ask if a sheep that had been killed with a greek knife could be eaten and he had heard joseph ask him if he knew the sheep had been killed with a greek knife and the man confessed that he had not made inquiry if he had known dan did not hear the end of the sentence but imagined that it ended in a gesture of in his day religion was limited to the law of moses a well out but the in had knotted and twisted the he had heard joseph maintain and stiffly too that an egg laid on the day after the sabbath could not be eaten because it had been prepared by the hen on the sabbath but one can t always be watching he said to himself and the discussion of such points seeming to him he drew back the window curtain and fell into admiration of his son s slim and great shoulders joseph was laughing with his companions at that moment and his teeth every one white and why do such interest him dan asked for his eyes are soft as flowers and he envied the woman that joseph would cross over in the night but very often men like joseph did not marry and a new arose in his mind he wanted children in a few years joseph should begin to look round meanwhile it might be well to tell him that like had always held that it is after the s rather than the letter we should strive and that in running after the latter we are apt to lose the former and he accepted the first opportunity to joseph who listened in amazement wondering what had befallen his father whom he had never heard speak like this before all the same he to these and laid them in his memory and fell to considering his father as one who had just along the road that he and his ancestors had come by without much question but if his father had set himself to consider and with that seriousness they i v v the brook deserved he would not keep back any longer the matter on which he had long desired to speak to him the young men to whom he had just good bye were all going to whither dan was accustomed to go every year for the feast of the but last year the journey f thither had fatigued him and it seemed to joseph that this year he should go to in his father s place and when he the subject dan who had been thinking for some time th at he was not feeling st enough for this journey welcomed joseph s proposal â a most proper presence joseph s would be at the feast joseph had come to the age when he should visit but he did not readily understand this sudden enthusiasm if he wanted to go to to the feast of the why had he not said so before dan whose thoughts reached back to the discussion overheard in the yard was compelled to ask joseph if it were for the purpose of discussing the value of certain minute points of law that he wished to go to at which joseph was astonished that his father should have asked him such a thing yet why not for a while back he was discussing such very points with some young his tongue as was its wont on all occasions though his mind was away and he suddenly stopped speaking and when the stirring of his father s feet on the floor awakened him he saw his father sitting pen in hand watching him and no doubt asking himself of what great and wonderful thing his son was thinking once again disappeared he stood in memories of things heard in s house or things only half heard for he had never thought of them since the words of the jews he met there had fallen dead at the time but now he remembered things that had passed over his mind the of the jews in awoke in him and a marvellous longing awoke to see the world first of all he must begin with and he bade his father good bye with an eagerness not too pleasant to the old man chapter v gone to the study of the law dan said as he walked up and down the room glancing often into joseph s letter for it figured to him the temple with the meditating on the law or discussing it with each other while their wives remained at home doing the work so do their lives pass over he said in the study of the law nothing else is to them of any worth my poor boy hopes that i shall forgive him for not returning home after the feast of the does he suspect that i would prefer him indifferent to the law in rather then in it at f a little surprised and shocked at the of his thoughts he drew them into order with the admission that it is better in every way that a young man should go to early in his life and acquire reverence for ,3

sat here on the strand of existence from which all that was dear to her had been launched into eternity he approached and addressed her in the accents of sympathy she raised her head and gazed wildly at him what was his astonishment at beholding by the bright glare of the lightning the very face which had him in his dreams it was pale and but beautiful trembling with violent and conflicting

danger of being i would offer my humble dwelling as a shelter myself as a devoted friend i am myself in paris and a stranger in the land but if my life could be of service it is at your disposal and should be sacrificed before harm or should come to you there was an honest earnestness in the young man s manner that had its effect his foreign accent too was in his favour it showed him not to be a

â an old fashioned heavily carved and furnished with the remains of former magnificence for it was one of those hotels in the quarter of the palace which had once belonged to nobility it was with books and papers and all the usual apparatus of a student and his bed stood in a recess at one end when were brought and the german student had a better opportunity of contemplating the stranger he was more than ever by her beauty her face was pale but of a dazzling set off by a profusion of hair that hung about it her eyes were large and brilliant with a singular expression that approached almost to as far as her black dress permitted her shape to be seen it was of perfect her whole appearance was highly striking though she was dressed in the simplest style the only thing approaching to an ornament which she wore black band her neck clasped by diamonds the perplexity now commenced with the student how to dispose of the helpless being thus thrown upon his protection he thought of his chamber to her and seeking shelter for himself elsewhere still he was so fascinated by her charms there seemed to be such a spell upon his thoughts and senses that he could not tear himself from her presence her manner too was singular and the adventure of able she spoke no more of the her grief had the attentions of the student had first won her confidence and then apparently her heart she was evidently an like himself and soon understand each other in the of the moment his passion for her he told her the story of his mysterious dream and how she had possessed his heart before he had even seen her she was strangely affected by his recital and acknowledged to have felt an impulse toward him equally it was the time for wild theory and wild actions old prejudices and were done away every thing was under the sway of the goddess of reason among other rubbish of the old times the forms and ceremonies of marriage began to be considered superfluous bonds for honourable minds social were the was too much of a not to be by the liberal doctrines of the day the german student why should we separate said he our hearts are united in the eye of reason and honour we are as one what need is there of sordid forms to bind high souls together the stranger listened with emotion she had evidently received illumination at the same school you have no home nor family continued he let me be every thing to you or rather let us be every thing to one another if form is necessary form shall be observed â there is my hand i pledge myself to you for ever for ever said the stranger solemnly for ever repeated the stranger clasped the hand extended to her then i am yours murmured she and sunk upon his bosom the next morning the student left his l ride sleeping and forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartments suitable to the change in his situation when he returned he found the stranger lying with her head hanging over the bed and one arm thrown over it he vol i g the adventure of spoke to her but received no reply he advanced to awaken her from her uneasy posture on taking her hand it was cold â there was no â her face was pallid and ghastly â in a word â she was a corpse and frantic he alarmed the house a scene of confusion ensued the ,6
some two or three stories of which he seemed somehow or other to have lost the in short it was supposed from some droll expression of the eye and a slight faltering of the tongue that mr was growing gay when matters were precisely in this condition by signs and secret messages to the attention of the company the old lawyer just as he was setting out with the history of a famous campaign dinner e

her niece stood on a far higher and must needs see much farther she had an immense admiration for her talents without much confidence in the material results which were to flow from them and this made her very about her niece s literary work s astonishment may be imagined therefore when one morning her aunt who had been making the tea as usual while she herself was busy at her desk suddenly inquired in a tone of mingled interest and my dear child who on earth is john for the moment thought that the remark was a personal one indeed it was as much through chance as through mrs s native simplicity that up to that moment the widow had never associated her with that name miss had taken it for granted that she knew her niece wrote under that but as we know had purposely concealed the fact from her john he is a writer in the â replied miss dart quietly what about him well there is a good deal h i m wo columns in per about him io â v â q the good any harm but mr seems to have got hold of a very queer i have not seen the yet it only comes out to day but i suppose it is sent to the newspapers in advance well the times has got it at all events and mr has got it too in another sense oh my dear how glad i am it is not you not of course that you would ever dream of writing such an article speaking evil of or at all events speaking of them in an way and so audacious from to end dear me observed with an irrepressible twinkle in her eyes how shocking i well of course you feel bound to stick up for the but you don t know when you have read the review bead it out to me put in smiling the tea is only just made and you have excited my interest immensely i wonder what poor mr will say is that how it begins my dear of course not this is how it begins â it is not our custom as our readers are aware to pass any opinion upon the from the nature of their publication they are mostly stately on the past and do not concern themselves as it is our less agreeable task to do with the topics of the day of late years however or indeed we may almost say of late months â so brief has been the existence of the in question â there has appeared among this class of a new candidate for favour it has appealed not as we understand without success to a larger audience and has established no httle reputation for originality of view it has carefully from with either this or that party and by its wit and wisdom has recommended itself to both to day however the has made a new departure though in what direction it is somewhat difficult to say its independence it must be admitted though still without any taint of as is commonly understood has taken the form of it lays an against authority itself and our whole social at the bar of e s i seems deserving of some â ox a the of the ages the itself bat from the boldness and vigour of the article in question which under the somewhat ambitious title of the good with the entire fabric of society it is evident that the writer who signs himself john is not one of those who while they are rarely bo as to name a date their belief in the good old times yet he that there were days â when none were for a party bat sm were for the state or at all events when the public interest was held of more consequence and the duties of were more generally than at present in these days he says our duty to the state is the very last thing which is considered even by honest folks men that would not wrong their neighbour of a shilling have little scruple in making a false return of their income to the tax i have observed of late years that even those in the newspapers from the of the concerning conscience money have disappeared the few people who had some lingering scruple in that way having apparently died out taxes of all kinds are looked upon in a different light from other debts and the very last light in which they are viewed is that of debts of honour to them is considered far from shameful at worst as at best as a clever stroke of business this arises not so much from want of patriotism as from habit and example for many generations the state has been looked upon as a cow by both political parties the members of which have got all they could out of it for their families and as a matter of course without the idea ever crossing their minds that they were the there is also another reason for this general it is much more easy to do our duty to our neighbour than to society at large a board or company is considered fair game for deception gentlemen and especially will pay half for their children when they travel by railway long after they have passed the age it does not strike them as a fraud and even when discovered they are not overwhelmed with shame as they would be if caught at cards t iâ aâ â

felt the same but none have done more ample justice to the feeling than the elegant bard from whom we quote who that would ask a heart to wed the calm the slumber of the dead no the wild bliss of nature needs and fear and sorrow the fire of joy i and without hopes without our without the home that love without the smile partial beauty won oh i what were â world s i the poetry of life ana when the poet â very joy to glimmer on my bat oh f the light of hope i what though my winged hour of have been like angel visits few and far between â we feel that to such a mind hope would come as a blessed messenger whose tidings would be of things sublime and pure and elevated above the low wants and wishes of a material existence we know of but one word in the whole of tliis beautiful poem which is at with good taste and we quote the line not from the pleasure of pointing out a single t in the midst of a thousand merits but for the purpose of showing how forcibly an error in taste strikes upon the attention and the feelings of the reader â the living lumber of hia kindred earth we are ready to imagine from this line that the author has scarcely been aware of the high degree of beauty and refinement which his work lumber in the poetical writings of pope might have occurred without any breach of taste because his and forcible style is more by power than elegance and lumber might therefore have been in keeping with the general tone of his expressions but here where all is music to the ear and harmony to the mind this uncouth word is decidedly out of place and while longing to exchange it for another we can only wonder that there should be but one small in so many fair and beautiful pages of genuine poetry adorned throughout with the most tender refined and elevated thoughts of is another poem strikingly of the influence of taste in the death song of the indian chief we observe how the poet has the indignant spirit of an injured man with the strong affections wild and visions of that interesting and dignified people and i could weep â th chief his wildly began but that i may not stain with grief the death song of my other s son i or bow this head in wo for by my wrongs and by my wrath i to morrow s breath that fires yon heaven with storms and death shall light us to the and wâ than share my boy i the s blood the s joy but hark the to morrow than in glory s shall dry thy tears even firom the land of shadows now my s ghost appears amidst the clouds that round roll he bids my soul for battle he bids me dry the he the only tears that ever burst from s soul because i may not stain with grief the death song of an indian chief lines on leaving a scene in full of the deep pathos of feeling afford one of the most splendid instances of the power of that faculty can strike with the rapidity of thought the of true harmony and the genuine music of the soul â die echo of its deep but secret passions we cannot read these lines without feeling that there is a language for the wounded spirit â a voice amidst the of that unknown whose melancholy is in with the feelings which we may not dare not and we inwardly bless the mournful for the wild sweet melody of bis most harmonious were we to attempt to quote passages from these lines the temptation would extend to the whole of this poem we can only recommend it to the reader ns one of the finest specimens of poetic taste as well as poetic feeling which our language all that has been said on the subject we feel that taste is something to be felt rather than defined yet of such importance to the poet that wanting this requisite he may sing for ever and yet sing in vain as well might the expect to charm his audience by playing what he them is the finest music on a broken or instrument as the poet hope to please without making himself thoroughly acquainted with the of taste â perhaps we should say with what is or is not in accordance with its rules for as a principle taste has not yet arrived ai a definite state of existence and if the young poet should read the pleasures of hope with reference to this subject and not feel in his very soul the conclusion presence and the power of taste he might bid adieu to the worship of the and devote genius to objects less elevated and sublime conclusion we have now examined the for writing poetry to none of which it would be wise to a station of because they are equally necessary to the success of the s art impression to furnish lasting ideas imagination to create images from such ideas power to strike them out with emphasis and truth and taste to recommend such as are worthy of approbation and to dismiss such as are not we have also been daring to maintain that poetry as a principle all nature and if the fact be acknowledged that poetry is neither written with that nor read with that delight which an earlier era in our history it becomes an important and interesting inquiry the cause that imagination should be exhausted is a moral impossibility because the creation of a thousand images in no way for the creation of a thousand more any one quality extracted from a former image and added to the whole or a part ,7

ruined man since even if the result of that inquiry should not be to compel the company to repay the enormous pecuniary losses which had been incurred by the catastrophe let only the price of the shares at present be compared with what it had been a few days ago â but he did not care to enter into that subject what was or pecuniary loss that it was a beggar on horseback to be mentioned at such a time as that when vas weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they were not and what was ruin or poverty to aim compared with the sting of that remorse which would never cease to torture him for having however innocently â however much in accordance with the highest scientific authority â neglected precautions by which this great calamity which had not spared even those who were nearest and dearest to him and his might have been averted so ingenious and eloquent indeed was the ex m p s that next to the immediate by the catastrophe there was no one who attracted so much public pity as the of that board which at first was looked upon as having been the cause of all that had happened even john to whose sagacity mr paid so many compliments at the expense of his own felt

in the society he would meet mr pole s roof might leave a permanent impression on him he had he felt shut his eyes to this matter long enough indeed too long and yet ever since he had made that confession to the lad respecting the though not on that account dick s presence had become more and more to it was strange indeed he should wish to part with one so dear to him but just as a man sometimes prefers a picture dearer to him than all other things he has yet one which he from looking on and hangs a curtain over it by reason of tain associations it so was it with francis as respected his son he would have been glad of the excuse of his former friend s invitation to get dick away and be left to himself and his grim and thoughts but on the other hand his conscience pricked him feeling that such a visit would not be good for the ud in this perplexity mr resolved to consult the who he was well aware would hold a strong opinion upon the subject and confirm him by the expression of it in the right course to need an ally in such a matter was of course a proof of weakness but on the other hand he called him in to what he knew to be amiss in himself and to the arguments of his own feelings directly he had sent for him he repented of it and had half a mind to recall the messenger and when mr came he could have found it in his heart to another cause for having sent for him instead of putting the case e him as he had intended to do for his judgment he even began to press upon him some arguments in favor of dick s going to that had had in fact but little force even with himself and that he well knew would be as dust in the balance in mr s mind when weighed against the dangers to which the young man fi principles would be exposed and which when even he was a boy the had painted in colors of you see the boy feels lonely here indeed i have never seen him so out of spirits as during this first week of his summer holidays there are no out of door sports to occupy himself in and at home heaven knows he finds no bright companion at on the contrary there is henry pole himself and his sister margaret and moreover on this occasion an old school fellow of dick s one a man of talent who is already at st s vi mi tv ot o t â xv less black than painted can t shut a lad up in the tower like a young princess in a â tale so that no person can get at him of course not said the rather unexpectedly and indeed there may he harm even at the tower you are wrapped up in your own pursuits and the boy is left not only to himself which as yon say affects his spirits but perhaps even to worse company such as and game mr at this for he saw in the last word a reference to mr george he had made him game keeper at the earnest of young d when he was a mere child but at a time when his wishes had had far greater influence with him than at present dick only knew that he was asking for for a dear companion who had a better acquaintance with birds and beasts than any natural history book and could find a s nest or a lark s with equal facility nor were mr s habits such as to make him with the man s character more than with that of other humble tenant of the estate but his compliance with his son s request had been little short of a public scandal mr had been more than once not only in trouble but its consequences in prison he had been hitherto a terror not to evil but to the of public order at all events as the woods and fields and he had married the prettiest widow in the parish at a period most immediate upon his first wife s death â within indeed six months of it it was this last much more than his that had made the first person in the parish next to mr and who i need not say was the s wife most bitter against him and she had done all in her power to get the appointment but her zeal had her discretion she had caused her mouth piece the to make his remonstrance in such vehement terms as had annoyed the squire in whom something of the old of obstinacy that had helped to him his father still remained the comely mrs had come up to the tower to plead her husband s cause â not upon its merits indeed but on the ground of her connection with dick in his earliest years and would perhaps have failed but for mrs that lady could not avoid remarking on that visit â it was not perhaps in female nature to refrain from doing so â in quarters through which it ward came round to the squire s ears that it would be shameful if he listened to the prayer of beauty instead of the voice of justice which had naturally the very contrary effect to that which was intended from that moment there had been a breach â so far as are possible among the elect â between the squire and the s wife and the subject of george was always a sore one with him i am not aware that richard has contracted hai m from any of my servants mr said the squire stiffly nor said the but he has ,12
five today he asked as he returned home with his wife she may fall through my fingers and be would have gone straight away to mrs if he had been able to rid himself of you u take me out to tea dick she said and to keep ber sober be took her to tea for the drunk would have suited him better than sober and he dared not go down to the pier next morning in search of mrs forest it being more than that might take it into ber head to son herself on the pier so he decided to wait the pier was too dangerous if he weren t interrupted by the might see them together and they might know mrs forest and tell her that he was a married man no he d keep his appointment with her at five but to get rid of required a deep plan it was laid and succeeded and at five he arrived at the hotel is mrs forest in the hall porter told the page boy to take mr up to mrs forest s rooms all this smells money dick said to himself in the lift the page boy threw open the door and after walking through a long corridor the boy knocked at a door and dick walked into b red twilight in which he caught sight of a green dress in a distant corner i hope you re not one of those people who require the glare of the sun always i like the son in its proper place out of doors and while thinking of an appropriate answer dick strove to find his way through the pieces of furniture all over the carpet come and sit on the sofa beside me s a s wife if you ll allow me he answered i will sit in this i shall be able to devote myself more completely to the hearing of your poem it was not polite to refuse to sit beside the lady but dick contrived to convey that her presence would trouble his intellectual enjoyment and the slight displeasure which the refusal had caused vanished out of the painted face this first success almost succeeded in up dick s courage to the point of asking her if he might remove the flower that stood on the cabinet behind him but he did not dare and at every moment he seemed to recognize a new scent an of burning drifted from a distant comer into a of in which the lady seemed to have encircled herself and which her every movement seemed to spread in more and more violent till dick began to think he would not be able to hold out till the end of the lady s narrative always gave him a headache but the word opera restored him to himself and with lips quivering like a cat watching a he heard that the subject of her opera was derived from her own life and telling him that it could not be understood without a relation of the events that had given it birth she drew her legs up on the sofa and leaning her head against the back commenced in a low but not disagreeable voice to tell of her first love adventure i might almost call my departure for some ten years ago a spiritual adventure she said the departure for seemed full of interest but from dick s point of view the leading up to the departure was prolonged and he found it difficult to listen with any show of interest to mrs forest s assurances that until she met the she had thought that babies were found in beds or under a s wife s bushes and this innocence of mind was so inherent in her that the had not succeeded altogether in her of it nor indeed did he ever attempt to do so she continued our friendship was founded purely on the intellect this admission was a disappointment to dick who had looked forward to the story of a novel love adventure which might easily be worked into a comic opera offering a suitable background with many pretty smiles he tried to lead the lady into the real story of her past but mrs forest insisted so well that he was fain to believe that there had been no past in her life suitable to comic opera her adventure had been animated by love of liberty and a noble desire to free an oppressed race from the rule of the she said full of nameless horrors dick would have liked her to name these horrors but before he could ask her to do so she was telling him of the instinct in every woman to mother something the had appealed to her sympathies and she had helped to bring about their by her poetry in three years she had learnt the language and had composed two volumes of poems in it i ve looked out copies of my poems for you and she leaned over the edge of the sofa towards a small table the movement her skirt and dick s eyes were by the show of a thick leg doubtless he said to himself the title of the first volume she said handing him the books is songs of a stranger my friend the and she mentioned an name contributed a preface the second volume is entitled new songs hy the stranger you will find a translation to each a s wife dick promised that he would read the poems as soon as he got home and begged mrs forest to proceed with her interesting story of the war in which

spoke with eyes in horror her cheeks and lips as white as ashes and as he ceased she breathed a long shuddering sigh and fell back as if dead her fall recalled victor to himself and his he raised her and sprinkled water on her forehead and kneeling by her as she revived he implored her to pardon his cruel the american life i have nothing to pardon poor victor t she replied you were scarcely conscious of what you were saying but i feel it must be true â it makes all clear now tell me as plainly as you can all that has occurred she rose up calm and pale put the damp curls from her face and walking to the window let the cool night air blow into the heated room then returning she sat down opposite to him saying now tell me all her stillness him and he related the oft told sad history how first induced to look on and see high play he had become so fascinated that he could not resist trying his luck he told of small and heavy losses of the frequent endeavor to draw out of the and of the irresistible enchantment when once in the fatal saloon this evening his had made a special effort for a rich prize was in view and it would be their last opportunity victor s uncle wished him to travel in europe of a foreign adventurer to improve some parts of his education and to make the acquaintance of several of his mother s relatives among whom was a young lady to whom he had been partly in childhood â a marriage greatly ed by both families on this day mr had received a large from one of his agents and this sum he gave to victor to deposit in the bank for his expenses while abroad you can have more if needful this is for your first all your preparations are now made my dear victor and you can sail next week when victor reached the bank he found it closed and as he turned away he met too late for a deposit my dear fellow yes answered victor then after a few minutes silence thinking he had responded too abruptly to his friend s he added have you any commands for france i am going next week so returned the other what now â business or pleasure r the american life business and pleasure said victor smiling good have you made your to madame la not yet but i will ere i leave the city better to night said she goes up the river to morrow for a fortnight and in the meantime i want your opinion on some pistols and other fancy articles victor thought as he must make one last visit it was of small consequence when and sauntered round with until it was time to make their appearance in the lady s apartments once there it was easy to keep him occupied until the tables were filled in s rooms and victor who was at receiving only a passing bow and smile from and was unable to manage a single moment to bid her farewell was at last carried off to take a parting glass of wine to his ban some of his friends also insisted on one last game and after a half hour s play victor laid a bill on the table saying of a foreign adventurer that is my farewell stake i am played out â that s gone too you exclaimed his opponent with a laugh seizing the pocket book which in his eagerness victor had dropped on the table played out with such a of bills that belongs to my uncle said victor but it is for your exclusive use said what does it matter if you use part for one pleasure or another and there added another your color has come up twice running while you have been losing time it was long before victor yielded to take just one note but one led to many and he rose from the table desperate and and all this sad story he told with the passionate eloquence of grief and despair â now breaking out into bitter self reproaches now into against those who had destroyed him and walking to and fro in his feverish anguish and and through all that pale the american ufe woman sat calm and silent with clasped hands lying on her lap and white lips firmly closed as if turned to stone but for the glittering eager fire in the watchful eyes and when all was told she still sat motionless watching the unhappy boy who exhausted by the emotions of the past few hours threw himself by the window and laid his head on the sill where the air swept over him as on healing wings at last she spoke poor victor she said and victor started at the sound of her voice started as if all this while he had in his own grief forgotten hers â so deeper ah forgive me he exclaimed forgive my selfishness in speaking so to you my kind friend my kind sister and he came and knelt beside her dear lady do you can you forgive me poor victor she again said sighing i have nothing to forgive i ought to have known all this before it is best i know it now of a foreign adventurer you will never seek the table again poor boy never never the experience of this night has changed me for ever but all is not over yet what is to come â what is before me â how shall i tell my uncle how shall i restore what i have â o that it were morning that i might know my fate you will tell your uncle all

henceforth sky of fire shall be above him and an earth of blood beneath â that all nature s voices shall speak to him the wrath of god and that his curse shall be to live when shall the at one ment

they have now no place to produce no opportunity to procure to my mind the most formal and hard natured of time the most of our own day would be recognised as a by the good master far sooner than this

money in trying to help others who were already past help when i not only might but should have saved most of it if i had never help sought and received it as it is i trust that my general obligation has been fully discharged as it first appeared was but the of what i sought to make it no journal sold for a cent could ever be much more than a dry summary of the most important or the most interesting of the day and such is not recollections of a busy life a newspaper in the sense of the term we need to know not only what is done but what is and said by those who sway the of states and and to this end the prompt perusal of the of ministers etc is indispensable no man is even tolerably informed in our day who does not regularly keep the run of events and opinions through the daily perusal of at least one good journal and the ready that no one can read all that a great modem journal contains only proves the ignorance or of the no one person is expected to take such an interest in the rise and fall of stocks the for cotton cattle grain and goods the proceedings of and courts the politics of europe and the phases of spanish american etc etc as would him to a daily perusal of the entire contents of a city journal of the first rank the idea is rather to in a single sheet the information daily required by all those who aim to keep posted on every important occurrence so that the lawyer the merchant the banker the the the author the etc may find here whatever he needs to see and be spared the trouble of looking a copy of a great morning journal now contains more than an average volume and its production costs far more while it is sold for a or part of the volume s price there is no other miracle of which at all approaches it the electric telegraph has the of journals in the great cities by increasing the cost of each of them the for example now pays more than one hundred thousand dollars per for intellectual labor included in and about its office and one hundred thousand dollars more for correspondence and â in other words for collecting and news and while its income has been largely increased from year to year its expenses have inevitably been swelled even more rapidly so that at the close of in which its the had been over nine hundred thousand dollars its expenses had been very nearly equal in amount leaving no profit beyond a fair rent for the premises it owned and occupied and yet its were satisfied that they had done a good business â that the increase in the patronage and value of the establishment amounted to a fair interest on their and might well be accepted in of a in the good time coming with cheaper paper and less charges for cable from the old world they will doubtless reap where they have now faithfully sown yet they realize and accept the fact that a journal hostile to the arts whereby the cunning and powerful few live without useful labor and often wealth by to lawless and popular vice can never hope to its so rapidly nor so vastly as though it had a soft side for the liquor traffic and for all to appetite and indulgence fame is a popularity an accident riches take wings the only earthly certainty is oblivion no man can foresee what a day may bring forth while those who cheer to day will often curse to morrow and yet i cherish the hope that the journal i projected and established will live and flourish long after i shall have into forgotten dust being guided by a larger wisdom a more sagacity to discern the right though not by a more readiness to embrace and defend it at whatever personal cost and that the stone which covers my ashes may bear to future eyes the still intelligible inscription founder of the new york xix the winter of though mild and open till far into was one of and

clinging helpless grasp that the tears to her eyes in her earliest had gone one of those experiences that are the diseases of the heart she had fancied herself â of a youth of her own age had secretly re l the fruit of the tree turned his devotion and had seen it from her by another such an incident as inevitable as the sometimes like that mild malady leaves traces out of all proportion to its actual the blow fell on with tragic suddenness and she under it thinking darkly of death and all hopes of future happiness her ready pen often her into her impressions and she now found an escape from despair in writing the history of a wronged in her tale the heroine killed herself but the author saved by this sacrifice lived and in time even smiled over her manuscript it was many years since had recalled this youthful incident but the memory of it to her as she turned from mr s door for a moment death seemed the easiest escape from what confronted her but though she could no longer medicine her despair by turning it into fiction she knew at once that she must somehow it into terms of action that she must always escape from life into more life and not into its she had been carried into mr

tree from the laboriously erected structure of human society may produce remote in that clumsy fabric she saw that having the of the stone she should have held herself apart from ordinary human ties like some set apart for the service of the temple and instead she had seized happiness with both hands taken it as the gift of the very fate she had herself she remembered some old greek saying to the effect that the gods never forgive the mortal who to love and suffer like a god she had dared to do both and the gods were bringing ruin on that deeper self which had its life in those about her so much had become clear to her when she heard declare his intention of laying the facts before mr his few broken words lit up the farthest verge of their lives she saw that his reverence for his wife s memory which was as far as possible removed from the strong passion of the mind and senses that him to herself was stained and by the discovery that all he had received from the one woman had been won for him by the act of the other this was what no reasoning no appeal to the calmer judgment could ever in his inmost thoughts undo or it could find only in the of all that had come to him from and this so different from the mere sacrifice of material well being was bound up with consequences so far reaching so destructive to the cause which had inspired his whole life that felt the helpless terror of the mortal who has launched one of the heavenly the fruit of the l she could think of no way of it but the way she had chosen she must see mr first must clear of the least faint association with her act or her intention and to do this she must not her own â for she could not depart from the exact truth in her feelings and convictions â but her husband s first instinctive movement of horror the of feeling her confession had really produced in him this was the most painful part of her task and for this reason her excited imagination clothed it with a special value if she could purchase s peace of mind and the security of his future by and even the momentary between them there would be a bitter joy in such payment her hour with mr proved the of her she could save only by

midnight the americans moved on the fort the advanced guard carried empty guns with fixed and thus faced the fire of the as they rushed over the works and made the british garrison prisoners when the war had lasted three or four years the th british government became convinced that it was a most difficult task to subdue the northern and middle fc tht bat states the people could not be even when j the armies were beaten but as there were more slaves and as the white population was more scattered in the is history of the united tes southern states it was supposed that it might be easier to them

from a certain flavor of brandy and tobacco smoke which all his ideas and expressions as well as his person another well remembered though strangely altered face was that of lawyer as people still called him in courtesy an elderly in his soiled shirt sleeves and tow cloth trousers this poor fellow had been an attorney in what he called his better days a sharp and in great brand among the and and and at all hours morning noon and night had caused him to slide from intellectual to various kinds and degrees of bodily labor till at last to adopt his own phrase he slid into a soap in other words was now a soap in a small way he had come to be but the fragment of a human being a part of one foot having been off by an axe and an entire hand torn away by the devilish grip of a steam engine yet though the hand was gone a spiritual member remained for stretching forth the stump that he felt an invisible thumb and fingers with as vivid a sensation as before the real ones were a and miserable wretch he was but one nevertheless wh the world could not on and had no right to scorn either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes since he had still kept up the courage and spirit of a man asked nothing in charity and with his one hand â and that the left one â fought a stem battle against want and hostile circumstances among the throng too another personage who with certain points of to lawyer had many more of it was the village doctor a man of some fifty years whom at an earlier period of his life we introduced as paying a professional to brand during the latter s supposed insanity he was now a purple rude and brutal yet figure something wild ruined and desperate in his talk and in all the details of his gesture and brandy possessed this man like an evil spirit and made him as and savage as a wild b and w mi as a lost soul but was supposed to be in him such wonderful skill such native gifts of healing beyond any which medical science could impart that society caught hold of him and would not let him out of its reach so swaying to and fro upon his horse and grumbling thick accents at the bedside he visited all the sick chambers for miles about among the mountain towns and sometimes raised a dying man as it were by miracle or quite as often no doubt sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon the doctor had an everlasting pipe in his mouth and as somebody said in allusion to his habit of it was always alight with hell fire these three pressed forward and greeted brand each after his own fashion earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black bottle in which as they he would find something far better worth seeking for than the sin no mind which has wrought itself by intense and solitary meditation into a high state of can endure the kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and to which brand was now subjected it made him doubt â and to say it was a painful doubt â whether he had indeed found the sin and found it within himself the whole question on which he had exhausted life and more than life looked like a delusion leave me he said bitterly ye brute beasts that have made yourselves so up your souls with i have done with you years and years brand ago i into your hearts and found nothing there for my purpose get ye gone why you scoundrel cried the fierce doctor is that the way you respond to the kindness of your best friends then let me tell you the truth you have no more found the sin than yonder boy joe has you are but a crazy fellow â i told you twenty years ago â neither better nor worse than a crazy fellow and the fit companion of old here he pointed to an old man dressed with long white hair thin and unsteady eyes for some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills inquiring of all travellers whom he met for his daughter the girl it seemed had gone ofi with a company of and occasionally tidings of her came to the village and fine stories were told of her glittering appearance as she rode on horseback in the ring or performed marvellous on the tight rope the white haired father now approached brand and gazed into his face they tell me you have been all over the earth said he wringing his hands with earnestness you must have seen my daughter for she makes a grand figure in the world and everybody goes to see her did she send any word to her old father or say when she was coming back brand s eye beneath the old man s that daughter from whom he so earnestly desired a word of greeting was the of our tale the very girl whom with such cold and purpose brand brand had made the subject of a experiment and wasted absorbed and her soul in the process yes murmured he turning away from the wanderer it is no delusion there is an sin while these things were passing a merry scene was going forward in the area of cheerful light beside the spring and before the door of the hut a number of the youth of the village young men and girls had hurried up the hill side impelled by curiosity to see brand the hero of so many a legend familiar to their childhood finding nothing however very remarkable in his aspect ,2
could not define to herself it had given her infinite pleasure to sing to a by pleasure she had experienced before not at least for a very long while and wondering what was about to she fell asleep xix the music room had seemed haunted with s and yesterday she had asked to walk with her in the lanes so that she might escape from it but to day half perplexed by her own she could not resist taking him to the picture gallery â she wanted to show him the the picture was in shadow and no longer the picture she remembered but when the sun shone all the rows quickened with and the little lady held out her striped skirt she had lost none of her bland delight and the gentleman who advanced to meet her bowed with the mock humility of and the beautiful of the floated into the hush of the trees and the f for a reason which her she was anxious to know how this picture would strike and she tried to draw from him his ideas concerning it their thoughts he said are not in their evening parade something quite different is happening in their hearts and while waiting for her and his stick he said â i can see that you always liked that picture youve seen it often before she had been longing to speak of he seemed always about them and in presence he seemed to them to stand like it was only by speaking of that his could be removed and she said that she had often been to the gallery with him having said so much it was easy to tell of the story of the three days of hesitation which had preceded her the and the lady playing the had seemed to her of the different lives by which that day had been pressed upon her choice explained that fate and free are not as as they seem for before birth it is given to ns to decide whether we shall accept or reject the gift of life so we are at once the creatures and the of destiny these excited and then her and she hastened to tell him how she had stood at the comer of square seeing the season passing imder the green foliage thinking how her life was in a single moment she remembered even the lady who wore the bright in her bonnet but she neglected to mention her lest should think that it was memory of this woman s horses that had decided her to the choice of her pair of she told him about the journey to france the buying of the and the day that madame had said if you ll stay with me a year i ll make something wonderful of you she told him how had sent her to the by herself and the madness that had risen to her brain and how near she had been to standing up in the carriage and asking the people to listen to her she told the tale of all this mental excitement carried away by the narrative suddenly she ceased and sat absorbed by the mystery she sat looking into that comer of the garden where the gardener on a high ladder worked his without pausing the light branches fell and she thought of how she had grown up in this obscure amid old instruments and old music she remembered her yearning for fame and love now she had both love and fame but within herself nothing was changed the same little soul was now as it had been long ago she could hear it talking living its intense life within her unknown to an thing unchanged among much change she remembered how like si had come to release her and all the passion of that time she had sat with him under this very tree she was sitting there now with everything was changed yet everything was the same she was going to fall in love with another man that was all she awoke with a start frightened as by a dream and before she had time to inquire of herself if the dream might come true she remembered the girl with whom used by to play in a drawing room hung with faded she feared that he would nothing and to her surprise he told her that it had happened two years ago at where he had gone for a month s holiday at that time when he was writing and the fairy maiden he had composed a great deal of the music hy the sea shore and in woods and to assist himself in the composition of the he used to take his with him one day while wandering along the dusty high road on the look out for a secluded shady place he had come upon what seemed to he a private park it was guarded hy a high wall and looking through an iron gate that had been left he was tempted by the stillness of the a music haunted spot if ever there was one he said to himself and encouraged by the persuasion of a certain melody which he felt he could work out there and nowhere but there he pushed the gate open and entered the park a perfect place it seemed to him no one but the birds to hear him and the sun s rays did not pierce the thick foliage of the grove never did place correspond more intimately with the mood of the moment and he played his melody over and over again every now and then stopping to write her step was so light and he was so deep in his music that he did not hear it she had been listening doubtless for some time before he had seen her he spoke very little french and she very little english but he easily understood that ,3
that she a visit to a firmly believes in not a yielding to passionate instinct the crossed himself again so innocent she looked he exclaimed ah how little one can tell by the faces of these women one came here from only the other day of whom the most dreadful things are said and before i knew i had remarked to one of our brothers who has a talent for painting that she would make a lovely the simple lunch served at the was of and i rested in the shadow of its walls until the sun was well on the way toward the horizon before departing i purchased a number of carved by the to keep or give away as when i reached the hotel de miss had dined it being so late that she had ceased to expect me i soon found that she was holding an audience with my rival in her temporary regard the who had been absent for the previous three or four days not caring to intrude on a conversation i had reason to suppose would have elements of privacy i went out for a stroll along the de la that magnificent way which cost it is said the sum of forty million dollars to create when i returned i was informed that miss wished to see me immediately and i went without delay to her rooms can you leave here with us in the morning was the question that greeted me as she opened the door for what point i asked somewhat astonished for out of having heard nothing about that city in connection with the business on hand i was naturally much surprised we shall stop for a night at on s account and go on the next day explained miss i could not think of anything to prevent my going my baggage could be packed in fifteen minutes have you heard news i asked yes she said and her voice lacked but nothing you can tell me not not yet the beautiful eyes faltered before my gaze after shall i still be kept in that will depend she said hesitatingly on your whim i inquired without undue politeness no oh no on circumstances that may arise trust me a little longer i pray in the morning remember she added as i rose to go get the garden to rouse you for the train goes early i told her there was no need of informing the g as i was an early and would not fail to be on time but when i was about ready for breakfast on the following morning one of the came to call me saying he had been asked to do so by miss on the train i occupied myself with amusing master who grew interested from time to time in the of mounted sometimes on sometimes on and again on horses which could be seen in the highway that is to be seen from the railroad across nearly the whole the priest told you of french africa this road is to be seen built of cracked stone after the plan invented or applied by and as well cared for as any drive around boston new york or through it is built up to a higher level with at frequent intervals for the quick rains through hills it is as carefully as the railway itself and even are found where required the object of all this expense is military the owners of the territory wishing to march their men or draw their cannon with expedition in case of need but the value to the country is as great as if it had been constructed solely for the use of peaceful travellers when the boy went to sleep i talked with miss about the territory through which we were passing and which both of us had seen before we said nothing that day in reference to her private affairs they might have escaped my mind but for the silent witness to what had been the pretty child lying on its pillow by its mother s side chapter the told you i was glad the stop was made at in passing through this section before i had only caught a glimpse of that most remarkable natural wonder the boiling which falls thirty feet over white rocks at a temperature of out of from whence comes this volume of water the thousands of that flow each minute day after day the year through and have done so for of centuries every little while the from below the can see small fish and floating in the stream showing that at some point below the surface rivers of cool water are into the and sent forth in those the steam not only from the great fall but from several smaller springs in the vicinity is constantly the air in the neighborhood and the effect of the whole scene is weird and marvellous the heat is so great that even at a distance of seven hundred feet away one cannot hold his hand in the running water the hotel was the i ever saw it consisted of the owner s residence the only part of which used by the guests appeared to be the and office with arranged in at some distance from the house built in rows like negro in the south of america the of the country made the appearance of these anything but assuring for they were with the main mansion by a bell or other contrivance and to add to the strangeness of the situation we

way side as he probably would without knowing it he would shudder and start back from the sight â there is something threatening appalling in the lonely and even in the intense strange solitude of the place but ah i if he knew as i do its history four times if not more since my brief acquaintance with this charming island began have gallant ships gone down in storm and in this fatal i learned the history of one of these companies from the of the church yard of there they were buried with the sad suited to such an occasion and with all the tenderness needed to soothe their hearts who were watching now so eagerly for the return of a ship what a picture of human life what a passage of human history it is sermons indeed in stones six of the passengers were of one affectionate family a gallant naval officer coming home from a long service with his wife a babe and three elder and beautiful daughters the brother of this lady had been expecting them daily he was one of the first on the island to be informed of their coming â and of how they had come â and to behold a spectacle which i will not describe let us hasten from the church yard of the name is a in my memory a glance at the burial place of the united brethren near in ireland may be a relief to the reader it is another of the spots one would choose for his bones to lie in â say what we will there is a choice and the thought of it is no matter to us while alive however little the et itself may concern us or others in future time the believe so at least they appreciate justly too the moral influence the religious science of a grave yard they do not deem it either decent to leave it neglected or necessary to make it frightful the little village which i visited one sabbath morning is in trees and with the of the country on every side â divided into a small harmonious arrangement of shaded streets that but for the neat rows of cottages and regular beds of flowers on either hand look more like natural lanes â remote from cities in a word â serene peaceful beautiful as a thought of paradise i attended service in the little church and afterwards walked through the grave yard which lies on the table land of a gentle green swell behind it skirted with flourishing and hedges and spotted over in hollow and heap with of a mellow september sunshine through branches of leaning i need not describe the scene in detail the customs of this in the care of their dead are known to all how truly are they in s lines on the graves of the â a from the haunts of men the loveliest nook of all that lovely where weary

stored in a lead lined box it is much better however to store plates at some distance from the room with the exception of those that may be required for immediate use as sold the plates are wrapped in paper and packed in in sealed boxes the sizes which it will be found suitable to stock are j inches by s inches known as quarter plate j inches by j inches known as whole plate and inches by inches it is a wise economy to use always the smallest plate that will include the desired view and such practice will help to justify the use of plates of the best though more expensive where possible the should decide in advance what plates he is likely to require and before the other work he get those prepared for use to do so the required plates are in the dark room without any illumination and each is enclosed in paper to ordinary light usually two are so employed â the inner one of orange colour the outer black in placing a plate in the first envelope it is necessary to know on which side of the plate is the sensitive and the absence of light may make this seem at first sight difficult with a very little experience however the side may be detected by touch being soft and by contrast with the side of bare glass which is cold and slippery another test suggested is by touching with the tongue to which the side is felt but touch alone is usually sufficient the side should be carefully then the plate placed in the orange coloured envelope with the towards the plain side of the envelope â that on which an address would be written then this envelope should be placed inside the black envelope with its towards the closed end and its address side towards the same side of the latter by this arrangement one can always know towards which aspect the side of the plate is turned this it is essential to know for the plate must always be turned with this sensitive side towards the x ray if turned otherwise the glass would interfere to some degree with the passage of the rays and in interpretation of the confusion would arise in right and left sides of the view this latter difficulty of interpretation from a alone where conditions of exposure are not carefully observed is no imaginary one as anyone with experience will know and especially is it so when a has to be to one anxious but ignorant regarding such matters to the difficulty we find it a good plan to a object opposite one definite corner of every this may take the form of a small no practical x ray work adapted for the purpose or a piece of metal may be fastened by material to the face of the envelope where a system is adapted of all plates by type in their exposure the number may be printed always in one defined corner this may be done by of separate numbers in solid or in type which are fastened on the face of the envelope by paper just before exposure and in the record book the exposure is entered under the corresponding number thus reference instead of metal type a may be written on with an ink made of a of a salt of in and spirit on this may be entered any information desired besides its reference number but although the latter plan sounds we have found the metal type more satisfactory the mark the sides of the may be made of a private nature so that as in legal cases advantage may be retained by the the plate thus prepared is placed in position under or over the part to be care being taken that its sensitive side as indicated by the plain or address side of the envelope be turned towards the patient and thus also towards the x ray with the above and plate below the weight of the part must be relied upon to keep the plate steady and in position with the below and plate above there is opportunity of some pressure on the plate besides keeping it steady this may serve to bring the plate in closer to the bony or deeper parts of which a view is usually desired which is desirable so as to avoid as far as possible for this purpose we find it good to place on top of the plate the flat board faced with sheet lead to which we have already referred the use of in a similar way is discussed in an earlier chapter on apparatus to avoid another source of the plate must be held as nearly in a plane as the of the surface will allow exposure completed the plate should be removed at once â from the room whether or not it be intended to proceed immediately with its development since even from a distance might seriously affect it y development to one acquainted with development of ordinary the after treatment of exposed x ray plates need offer no difficulty in each case the impression made on the sensitive plate by may be to be latent since no change ia visible in it until acted on by a suitable or this ia simple if intelligent care be in its direction but much of the success of a may nevertheless depend upon it care and cleanliness are the two chief for its execution many excellent of are published which explain the and details of the process of development and perusal of one of these will well repay anyone with the subject to whom the brief notes here set down may be insufficient as a complete guide later on we shall detail the steps of the process but consider a few important points the time occupied by development will depend naturally upon the length of exposure relative to the subject ,13
the roadside and the of the influence of a colder than that of england indeed the of all the crops a difference of at least a fortnight in climate between s at and london wheat has hardly filled jet in the are barely headed and the grass is little more than half cut and not half dried into hay on the contrary it now looks as jf it must winter on the ground or be taken in thoroughly water soaked being so much later the crops are far less blown down here than they are in england but neither grass nor grain is generally heavy while potatoes and though backward looked remarkably vigorous and promising beautifully is all this country well clear of weeds and evidently in hands of intelligent industrious scientific wood is quite plentiful oak especially though shade trees are not so frequent in cultivated fields as in england but rough rocky spots are quite common here though in the and these wisely devoted to growing timber is more genial and more fertile but i have rarely seen a tract of country better than that stretching westward from to miles and thence down the to some miles further the farmers in our valley ought to pass through this gloomy chilly misty country and be into a better improvement of their rare but advantages is useful in that it gives us a more vivid idea of the immense amount of knowledge we yet lack i supposed till to day that by of a scotch irish in part and a fair acquaintance with the works of walter scott burns c i knew the scotch dialect pretty thoroughly and yet a notice plainly posted up this lot to completely me on inquiry i learned that to a lot means to let or lease it for building purposes â in other words to be built upon on a ground rent i suppose i learned this years ago but had entirely forgotten it the though a fair stream at is quite d narrow for twelve to fifteen miles below that city seeming hardly equal to the at or the at but then it has a good tide which helps the matter and has at great expense been out so as to be for vessels of several hundred we passed a fine american packet ship with a very wholesome looking body of scotch bard some ten miles below and i was informed that a large vessel even though by a is seldom able to get down into deep water upon a single tide but is stopped h ri to wait for another this river fairly wi of there are regular lines connecting with north west of england liverpool london c we met four or five boats returning from excursion parties crowded with the better paid and of their wives and children the banks of the for some miles below are low and much the being devoted to a rude has been interposed on either side consisting of stones of five to fifty pounds each intended to prevent the washing away of the banks fa the ripple raised by the often passing the end is fairly though not as we descend the shores become bolder the rugged hills at first barely visible on the right come near and nearer the water low rocks begin to lift their heads above the surface of the stream while others have their innate modesty overpowered by wooden lifting their heads above the highest tides to warn the of his danger at length a gigantic of rock rises out of the water on the right of the channel to a height of fifty or sixty resembling some vast old cathedral this is castle with the famous but now town of lying at the head of a small bay behind it a little lower on the left is fort mo at the head of for very large vessels and three miles lower still is quite a stirring somewhat to hip building here our boat which had left miles above at p held on till for the train which left the same port at with the mail and additional passengers and then laid her coarse directly across the channel to miles from where she is due at to morrow morning looks more american than any other city i have seen in europe half of on to half of philadelphia would make a city very like iron is said to be made cheaper here than elsewhere in the world the ore being with a substance which the process and the cost of melting tall chimneys and black columns of smoke are abundant in the vicinity the city is about twice the size of with more than double the trade of that capital and has risen rapidly from relative new rows of stately houses have recently been built and the court end of the city is extending rapidly toward the west a brown or dark gray stone as in is the principal material used and gives the city a very substantial appearance most of the town being new has wide and straight streets in the older part they are perverse and as old concerns are apt to be they have an old cathedral here now of which the citizens seem quite proud i can t perceive why it seems to me a sad waste of stone and labor the other churches are also mainly and while making less pretensions are far more creditable to the taste of their the town is built on both sides of the which is crossed by fine stone bridges but seven of it lie on the north ancient embracing the narrow and crooked streets lies nearly in the and is crowded with a and miserable population at least half the women and children including mothers wit children in their arms and grand mothers or

such a case without admitting it to her dearest friend she was made to be loved that girl was and it makes me sad every time i think of her living alone in that solitary flat mrs did not relish over much this she remembered the time when this same had caused her uneasiness in the days of her early acquaintance with it gave her a start to hear him her now in that enthusiastic way she had never had a moment s jealousy of her husband since their marriage she had a glimpse for a second of how she should feel if ever gave her cause for a visit from the green eyed monster if had been told when her concealment of s troubles began that she would have gone as far in her defence as she was now going she would have the idea with the utmost indignation her loyalty to her friend was the of what was really a trait in her disposition the demands upon her came so gradually that one step led into another before she realized what she was doing first it was to pretend that the reason mr did not come to was because he had taken a journey to the far south next she gave little things in the way of clothing out of her own stock as she found them needed pretty soon when the two women were together new articles for s original use were purchased with mr s money it was not so very wrong said to herself it did not amount to a great deal and needed the things badly she would use less that might have a share the young wife was so deeply attached young fa s to her friend that she could not bear to think of a separation and whatever was in s purse was equally at s disposal frank had had his way long before had dreamed of it skilled in the art of winning women he had slowly but surely taught to believe that the love she felt for him should be more to her than the tie the law recognized as binding her to a man she feared and hated the meetings came to mean a glimpse of heaven to the young woman to do frank what justice we may he had a real affection for and from the time he could call her his own he gave her the that a real wife might have claimed she did not want to go to live at boston for her attachment to was at least the second strongest one she had and was well pleased to remain in new york it was at her that mrs persuaded her husband to remove to forty second street where their homes could be adjacent the flat that occupied was a very one and was completely deceived when she came to her with the story that her husband had agreed to send her a small sum each month that would cover the rent and an economical table she saw no reason why should tell her an had a fixed income and it was reasonable that he should have concluded to do the decent thing and let his wife have a part of it mrs acting under the direction of a head than her own bought her furniture on and maintained such an air of quiet poverty that offered assistance in many ways which was accepted with tb warmest thanks for young s six months after she began housekeeping numerous articles were bought on the account and delivered at the other flat with instructions to the not to mention it to mr when the bills were presented in case he complained that they were excessive to help and protect her friend had to disgrace her husband before many people from the kitchen girl to the and the coal dealer there was a row of individuals who knew that mrs was buying goods in the name of one house and them sent to another and every one of them had their own suspicions as to the object which the pretty young wife had in this deception the first thing that discovered was on a winter s morning when went at an hour earlier than she had ever selected to make a call on mrs something had arisen which she wanted to discuss with her friend and she ran over as soon as left the house she did not ring the lower bell as a tenant was entering the at the moment but walked up the stairs and knocked at the parlor door of the apartment she sought hearing no response she knocked again this time much louder when the faint whispering of two persons inside came to her astonished ears the whispering ceased and after a moment s pause mrs again this time in a manner then the noise of some one moving was heard and a form approached the door who s there said a voice which she easily recognized as s was the answer let me in i want to talk to you young there was a new and a delay that long but finally the door was opened and mrs was discerned half covered with a that she had hastily slipped on what a terrible time it takes you to open a door i said mrs looked as if she should sink to use a familiar feminine comparison she had about the of a rag doll and was totally unable for a few moments to make the least reply mrs saw that something unusual was the matter and thought it the part of kindness to inquire you look like a ghost said she take a seat and tell me what has happened to excite you so mrs accepted the suggestion and sank upon the sofa she was so evidently suffering that sat down beside her and embraced her affectionately tell me all about it my ,5

to his sorry or wakes therein on the morrow in a sober and practical mood his very exaltation now past has rendered him more keenly susceptible to the and which hem him in his house seems narrow his food coarse his furniture scanty his prospects gloomy and those of his children more sombre if possible and as he off to the day s task which he has too long neglected and for which he has little heart he too falls into that train of thought which is beginning to the globe and of which the burden may be freely rendered thus â why should those by whose toil all comforts and luxuries are produced or made available enjoy so scanty a share of them why should a man able and eager to work ever stand idle for want of employment in a world where so much needful work impatiently the doing why should a man be required to surrender something of his independence in accepting the employment which will en able him to earn by honest effort the bread of his family why should the man who faithfully labors for another and receives less than the product of his labor be held the obliged party rather than he who the work and makes a good bargain of it in short why should speculation and ride so in their carriages honest work as it humbly and by on foot â such as i interpret it is the problem the of i which and the knotted brain of toil in our day let us it but first let us look at the whole matter in the light in which it presents itself to or the of the established order of things we can lose nothing we may gain something of insight by so regarding it which will reward a few moments attention is the value of a fact if we do but rightly apprehend it and very strong is the inherent presumption that the shape things have actually and as we say naturally taken is the very best they could have taken all things considered including the nature of man let us look then at this whole matter of labor its condition and as it must appear to the men of substance and of all around us all extreme statements begin and end in error and nothing can be more mistaken than the vulgar presumption that wealth goes by luck or in fact that regarded there is any such thing as luck in the universe the man of respectability and property whose blocks of houses adorn the streets of our towns and whose note goes in bank can you think him distinguished by no substantial qualities from those who were his and and who are now his tenants and o rely on it there is no such instance of results without a cause in nature the man may be no better i readily grant you than those around him â perhaps in the truest sense no wiser â but very he must be and for that one purpose of property a vastly superior being tried in history or geography in or the he might prove of small account but in that wisdom which dollars from rocks and from and he must be an nay i go farther and insist that a keen eye would have readily picked bim out from among his a said f e fe who will die a t i i hints toward blocks of stores now let us see how the questions we must appear to this practical man trace his history closely and you will find that in his boyhood he was and â that he expense and that he and seldom unless at others cost â that he was rarely seen at balls or â that he was in study and in that he did not hesitate to do an uncomfortable job if it b de fair to be profitable r that he his hours and made each count one either in earning or in preparing to work he rarely or never stood idle because the business offered him was esteemed or disagreeable â he laid up a few dollars during his which proved a sensible help to him on going into business for himself â he married â he lived and steadily until it clearly became him to live better and until he could employ his time to better advantage than at the or over the bench thus his first thousand dollars came slowly but surely the next more easily and readily by the help of the former the next of course more easily still until now he adds thousands to his with little effort or care but the of all this spreading oak was in the tough whence it sprang given the original qualities of the lad all beyond was plainly unless prevented by death or some extreme calamity now we shall but waste our breath in attempting to convince this man that the world is not a very good world as it stands and labor rewarded exactly as it should be talk to bim of the wants and woes of the poor and he will answer you that their sons can afford to smoke and drink fi which he at their age could not and that he now meets many of these poor in the market buying luxuries that he can not afford dwell on the miseries by a of employment and he will reply op labor that he never encountered any such obstacle when poor for when he could find nothing better he cleaned streets or stables and when he could not command twenty dollars a month he fell to work as heartily and cheerfully for ten or five in vain will you seek to explain to him that his rare faculty both of doing and of finding to do â his wise of means to ends in all circumstances his and ,8
a slave state the defeat of that effort showed that it had been made too late â that the north should have insisted on tlie of slavery from at least her share of immediately after its purchase from

there quietly establish and itself while that region is called a territory intending and expecting to and it when said region shall present itself for recognition and admission as a state is a

again mr in liis purer nobler days â before he became the leader and of a great party which in spite of his gave liim the for president of nearly all the essentially slave states and leaned more and more upon the slave power for support so long as that power had a substantial existence â had proposed and nearly carried in the continental of the absolute of slavery from all the territory then belonging to or likely to be acquired by the old the war was then barely ended the british troops held the city of new york and the accidental absence of a member from new probably prevented the at that time of a policy which would have realized the hopes of our heroes and by quietly gradually tending to and the peaceful of human bondage from our the slavery c y to have confined it as mr and proposed to the existing states which saw fit to it making their bounds a limit beyond which it could not pass would not have been an nor heroic but m ould have been a cheap quiet and certain mode of the country of its most gigantic wrong and peril but mr was soon sent to france and the next reduced his programme so as merely to slavery from all the territory then possessed by the the r on lying between the and the and when the vast wild country then known as came to be acquired from france though few years had passed and mr was then at the of his power no potent voice was raised in of at least its still virgin soil or even the northern half of it to free labor forever there is a sad pathos in the simple another king arose who knew not joseph but in these faster ages we do not need to await the wrought by death our kings forget not merely their but whatever was best and noblest of themselves mr having thus in proposed and all but carried the of slavery absolutely and forever from all the territory contained within our national boundaries and not yet embraced within the of our thirteen states though much of it was still the especial property of north and both slave states in

the society that the prosperity and hi of society depend not upon m american and granted to one class or order of society at the expense of another c that all free trade of whatever description must be a mutual benefit to the parties concerned in it that countries should study to direct their labours to those of industry for which their situation and circumstances are best adapted c c all which as general principles no one or doubts but the question is left untouched whether the of a whole nation can be called a or measures taken to save it from the attacks o foreign jealousy an that we have at present free trade with any nation on earth is not asserted and would be difficult to establish nor is any attempt made to show the mutual benefit arising from our commerce with great britain in particular that the situation and circumstances of the united states are best adapted to without is equally and these of which the above are but specimens leave the question precisely where it was before the same remonstrance is still more unfortunate in its facts doubtless without any intention to thus the virginia are made to say we ask no tax upon for our benefit neither do we desire any thing of government to enable us to cultivate the soil as as we could wish but to leave us free so far as it depends on them to carry our to the best we can find and to purchase what we want in return on the best terms we can either at home or abroad c one is almost tempted to conclude from the of the assertion in the above sentence that the gentlemen who made it were not aware of the existence of any duties whose or object is to protect agricultural industry and particularly the agricultural industry of the southern states from the dangers of foreign competition yet tobacco in the leaf is subject to a duty of fifteen per cent american tobacco pays ten per cent per pound and snuff twelve cents for the protection of the of virginia and the other states that raise tobacco cotton is subjected to a heavy duty cheese spirits from grain and coals are also to the benefit of whether the object of these was merely or a protection of from foreign we know not certain it is the effect cannot be mistaken the truth therefore is that at this moment a of cotton goods is not allowed by the policy of our laws when he purchases his raw material to enjoy the benefit of that which the remonstrance to buy as cheap as you can no matter where but is forced to procure his cotton from his own countrymen without having the advantage of that between the foreign and domestic growth of the article which the remonstrance declares it is the duty of every wise and just government to secure to him he his tobacco his his his cheese under the same imposed on him for the benefit of the yet it is said he must not expect any of favour the and the farmer from whom he is obliged to buy his cotton tobacco c at a price ten per cent higher than he need g ve for them if the laws allowed him free access to a foreign market are not to be prevented from going into that same foreign market and goods there at a price lower than the of their own country can afford because of the operation of these very laws to sell them for this is an important fact and quite lost sight of in most of the essays resolutions c against domestic whether the present system in this respect is right or wrong we do not pretend to say the remonstrance terms the of the earth the fountain head of all wealth of all power and of all prosperity it claims for them however no exclusive privileges and those who american it probably were not aware that the law gave them any from foreign we do not purpose at present to contend for either the plan adopted or the plan proposed but to remark upon the obvious in the reasoning which are addressed to the public on either side mr s three letters are worthy the attention of all such as desire to form their opinions on the subject he is a zealous a and an able advocate he has written much and of course thought much on this question and his writings have the advantage of being free from the and as to that the value of so many productions of less experienced of either side it has appeared to us that in his writings and in the addresses of the philadelphia society there has been too frequent a reference to the example of england and too confident a reliance on the made from circumstances in her history â let him answer this objection in his own words the following extract is from the seventh page some of our have written long essays protesting against the example of england in consequence of the immense numbers and the distress and misery of her poor â and the wars she wages which they charge to the account of her the misery of her poor arises from their labour

the first she had rejected the notion that any other tie save one of warm friendship founded on mutual esteem and admiration united lady to the earl and this conviction was now strengthened and confirmed by the result of her own observation besides felt an inward assurance from words accidentally dropped from time to time by lady that the cloud which often her new friend s brow arose from some secret attachment she had formed abroad lady in all their together turned the conversation from herself never admitting the possibility that her heart could bestow itself on any one and seldom alluding to her residence abroad and her friend had been talking together for about half an hour â her husband and sir being the prominent subjects of discussion â when after a smart rap at the door lady s maid entered with a letter or small packet in her hand though a very old and faithfully attached was never remarkable for of manner or sweetness of and now her features were pinched up into very indications of discontent this letter or whatever it may be my lady was left for yon an hour and a half ago by a person who requested to with me and gave very particular that it should be delivered without delay i told the man that i could not undertake to give the letter to your before you retired for the night but here it is my lady a soiled dirty thing scarcely fit to present to your very well you did quite right to receive it replied lady carelessly taking a little square packet from her maid if i might offer a suggestion lady i should caution jou against opening that envelope there seems a box or something hard inside in italy one has heard of strange presents having been sent to ladies will not your allow me first to examine it exclaimed hastily seizing her mistress s arm no i dare say its contents are perfectly harmless i require assistance you see miss is at hand so â i need not detain you here any longer replied lady with visible effort suddenly putting down the packet on her knee murmured something to herself and then with evident reluctance obeyed her mistress and quitted the room as soon as the door closed turned and cast a long glance on her with an feeling of immediately arose and occupied herself at the table close at hand she heard the slight crash of the paper as the envelope of the letter yielded to lady s impetuous touch and immediately afterwards a low exclamation either of pain or astonishment made her hastily turn again towards her friend by the light of the fire she then saw something glittering glide from the envelope over lady s white gown to the floor sprang forwards to restore it but lady with a face pale as ashes hastily her and hid the object in her bosom dear lady i fear you are ill said quickly do not be frightened i shall be directly replied lady rapidly as she saw miss s eye glance towards the bell astonished beyond measure sat down again lady buried her face in her hands while a tremor shook her frame the packet was from mr and enclosed the half of the clasp on the reception of which lady had promised to meet her lover at any hour or place he chose to indicate the following few words were traced on the paper in which the jewel was wrapped â â half past eleven to night in the at the end of the walk f k it was no slight proof of lady s love and faith and of his empire over her that mr asked a guest at was it possible that she could with his request without danger of her reputation this it was the humiliating feeling of carrying on a that brought the flush to her cheek and which turned her joy into shame and distress she sat under this sense of humiliation and shrinking from the pitying gaze of s eyes yet the intense desire to behold him she loved again burned strongly within to fail mr now would be to the of her dearest hope â the of her marriage for had he not promised â pledged himself â at their next interview to explain the mystery this secret which bound her as it were with iron a smile bright and beamed over her expressive features then she arose and after standing a minute in gloomy meditation over the fire advanced to the windows and drawing back the curtain gazed without she then walked to the table and taking up s watch looked at the hour the hands pointed to eleven onr knowledge of each r been brief we have been thrown together a great deal and events have our intimacy during this short period probably more than of casual intercourse would have done as a climax to our singular friendship you must now believe and think just the very opposite to what you are about to hear and witness i cannot explain yet i tell you that even though contrary to your senses you must believe me pure and incapable of a action as yourself but to the point i am under an imperative to meet a person this night can you direct me to some private mode of to the gardens asked lady in a low resolute voice returning to the fire she shrank beneath the gaze of bewildered utter incredulity which she read in s eyes are you serious surely â surely not it cannot be i exclaimed rising and gently taking lady s trembling hand which rested on the mantel piece cannot you believe it when i â i tell it you do you imagine that i would undergo this humiliation for or encounter your withering astonishment for the sake of a jest replied lady passionately away ,7

a very lofty soldier like port pâ tâ r s court somewhat particular in hia dress dressing himself when not in in simple but rich and was especially noted for having his sound leg which was a very comely one always arrayed in a red and high shoe though a man of great of manners yet there was something about him that rude while it encouraged frank and even social intercourse he likewise observed some appearance of court and etiquette he received the common class of visitors on the stoop before his door according to the custom of our dutch ancestors but when were formally re in his parlour it was expected they would appear in clean linen by no means to be and always to take their hats off on public occasions he appeared with great pomp of for in truth his station required a show and dignity and always rode to in a yellow with red wheels these symptoms of state and ceremony properly the porch commonly in front of with benches on each side what government the least popular consider ble discontent among the they had been accustomed to find easy access to their former and in particular had lived on terms of extreme with the they therefore were very impatient of these dignified precautions which intrusion but peter had his own way of thinking in these matters and was a of the dignity of office he always maintained that government to be the least popular which is most open to popular access and control and that the very against court ceremony and the reserve of men in power would soon despise rulers among whom they found even themselves to be of consequence such at least had been the case with the administration of william the who bent on making himself popular had listened to every man s advice suffered every body to have to his person at all hours and in a word treated every one as his thorough equal by this means every and public was enabled to measure wits with him and to find out the true dimensions not only of his person but his mind â and what great man can stand such scrutiny â it is the mystery that of government great men gives them half greatness we are always inclined to think highly of those who hold themselves aloof from out examination there is likewise a kind of reverence for office which leads us to the merits and of men in power and to suppose that they must be constituted rent from other men and indeed is as necessary in politics as in religion it ce is of the first importance that a country should be governed by wise men â but then it is almost important that the people should believe to be wise for this belief alone can produce

sir what proposition is this book intended to set forth and what fact does it reveal wliat is its drift its purport if it a new truth or even a new suggestion though it seem a very mistaken and absurd one make way for it and let it fight its battle but if it has really other aim than to be therefore and thus to win gold for its author and his the and then let a be made of its manuscript sheets so that the world may speedily obtain from it all the light it is capable of i once received a letter from a somewhat noted pressing me to read thoroughly one of his works just issued wliich the cover proclaimed his greatest novel and which he me to commend to general favor saying he was anxious to do his part toward the of the poor from their and miseries i was not able to read the book â receive too many like this but i replied to the letter saying in substance you wish to improve the condition of the poor well allow me to suggest a way take hold of the first piece of vacant you can gain permission to use plant an acre with potatoes cultivate and gather them give one half to as a poor creatures as really need them and save the balance for your own while you grow more next year in this way you will do more toward the condition of the poor than you could by writing novels from july to eternity my friend did not take my advice â he did not even thank me for it but he soon after started a newspaper whereof he sent me the first five numbers in every one of which i received a most the paper is since dead but i have no doubt its editor continued his to the last and died laying it on with whatever vigor he had left could not help that i never made any reply but my convictions as expressed in my letter to him remain unchanged to this day yet let us not seem to the author s nay we dare not we cannot there is no other earthly exercise of power so enduring how many generations liave flourished and vanished since the book of job was and how many more will rise and fade leaving that sublime old poem still fresh and li ing see still studied and admired by the youth of nations unknown to rome in her greatness all other power to the pagan era of the eternal city has long since passed away forever nay consider how living in a world so very from ours â in many respects so compared with ours â can still instruct the wisest and delight the most critical among us and you may well conclude that to write nobly is a lar than to rule to conquer or to kill and that the truly great author looks down on the little and of mankind from an eminence which can but feebly and the ages can scarcely wear away but eminence in any good or great undertaking intense devotion â patient laborious exertion either in the doing or in the preparing for it he who fancies greatness an accident a lucky hit a stroke of good fortune does sadly the achievement contemplated and the wisdom and justice wherewith the universe is ruled ask who among modem poets have written most admirably so far as manner and finish are regarded and the lover of poetry least acquainted with literary history will answer â pope gray he may place others above any or all of these in power in genius in force but he cannot doubt that these have most smoothly happily sung what they had to sing â that their thoughts have lost less than almost any others by or of expression then let him turn to biography and he will find that these men have nearly or quite all others in patient study in fastidious determination to improve so long as improvement was practicable in persistent labor so long as labor could possibly avail it was quite easy for pope to say the things i have written have always pleased most for he always studied and himself full of a subject before he began to write about it and his composition was merely a setting down and arranging of ideas already present in his mind and yet i that posterity has not his judgment i mean that liis works which pleased most when first published have not stood the test of time as well as some others the world of letters knew him as a pains taking laborious correct writer even before he had established liis claim to be honored as a great one and the works he wrote so rapidly he afterward corrected altered before allowing the public to see them to the sad encouragement of among so that on one occasion his decided that it would be easier to compose in type afresh than attempt to correct one of his proofs no man ever v better so far as style is regarded because no man was ever more determined to publish nothing that he could improve so considered four lines of his deserted village a good day s work and the world has literature as a his judgment with the kindred of gray this belongs to a school of poetry which i do not admire but its excellence after its kind i presume no one has ever doubted and it is related of the most fastidious and the most melodious writer of our time that a friend once travelled with him all day and was surprised by his and abstraction until just before night his face lighted up and he exclaimed like the old greek i liave it that will do â then explained to his startled companion that he had been all day ,8
t mean that he is so and superstitious as that then the reason of his opposition really is that he believes his death to be in the of yes he thinks that and the priests turned out of the main road how beautiful it looks and father stopped to admire the abbey stood on one of the lower slopes on a overlooking rich water meadows formerly lands the legend says that the abbey shall be when a de is and the were originally de they changed their name in the century on account of a of committed by them a roof shall be put on those walls the legend says when a de is again of and the shall be slain on the and to save himself from a violent death he will only allow you to roof a part of the abbey now what reason does he g ve for such an extraordinary decision are ever expected to have reasons the priests laughed and father said we might appeal to rome a lot of good that would do us haven t we all heard the say that any of his priests who appeals to rome against him will get the worst of it i wonder that he dares to defy popular opinion in this way what popular opinion is there to defy wasn t saying to me only yesterday that the was a brave man to be letting any roof at all on the abbey and is the best educated man in this part of the country people will believe anything yes indeed and the priests stopped at the grave of an na or john of the priests and father told father how a young priest who had lost his way in the mountains had fallen in with na offered to put him into the right road but instead of doing so he led him to his house and closed the door on him and left him there tied hand and foot s sister who still clung to religion the priest and he fled passing who was on bis way to fetch the soldiers followed after and on they went like hare and hound till they got to the abbey there the priest who could run no further turned on his foe and they fought until the priest got hold of s knife and killed him with it but you know the story why am i telling it to you i only know that the priest killed is there any more of it yes there is more and father went on to tell it though he did not feel that father would be interested in the legend he would not believe that it had been that an ash tree should grow out of the buried head and that one of the branches should take root and pierce s heart and he was right in suspecting his s lack of sympathy father at once objected that the ash tree had not yet sent down a branch to pierce the priest s heart not yet but this branch nearly touches the ground and there s no saying that it won t take root in a few years but his heart is there no longer well no mid father it isn t but if one is to argue that way no one would listen to a story at au father held his peace for a little while and then he began talking about the times telling how religion in ireland was another form of love of country and that if were to every form of it was because they instinctively felt that the questioning of any would mean some slight from the idea of that held the people together like the ancient jews the irish believed that the faith of their forefathers could bring them into their ultimate inheritance this was why a was hated so intensely more opinions father said to himself i wonder he can t admire that ash tree and be interested in the story which is quaint and interesting without trying to draw an historical parallel between the irish and the jews anyhow thinking is better than drinking and he jumped on his car the last thing he heard was s voice saying he who his religion his country confound the fellow me with his preaching on this fine summer s day much better if he did what he was told and made up his mind to put the small green on the abbey and not those coarse blue things which will make the abbey look like a common barn then his eyes with his hand he peered through the sun base following the shapes of the fields the com was six inches high and the potatoes were coming into blossom true there had been a of water but they had had a good summer thanks be to god and he thought he had never seen the country looking so beautiful and he loved this country this poor western plain with mountains the horizon were feeding between the they raised their shaggy heads to watch the ear passing in the distance cattle were the flies how beautiful was everything â the white g g in the blue sky and the trees there were some trees but not many â only a few pines he caught glimpses of the lake through the stems tears rose to his eyes and he attributed his happiness to his native land and to the thought that he was living in it only a few days ago be wished to leave it â no not for ever but for a time and as his old car through the he wondered how it was that he had ever wished to leave ireland even for a single minute now which do you reckon to be the shorter road the shorter road your reverence is the road but i doubt if we can get the car through ,3
by those who are now living the we speak of is the dim and diminished reflection of him who filled a distinct calling in a period that has long gone by the regular â the herald and historian of individual families the faithful of his long descended patron â has not been in existence for at least a century and a half perhaps two he with whom we have to do is the humble old man who feeling himself gifted with a strong memory for history old family and lore in general passes a happy life in going from family to family comfortably dressed and much dropping in of a saturday night without any previous notice bringing eager curiosity and delight to the of the house he visits and filling the ears of the old with tales and legends in which perhaps individuals of their own name and blood have in former ages been known to take a remarkable and conspicuous part indeed ere is no country in the world where from the peculiar features of iu social and political changes the of the would be more likely to produce such a thk irish effect as in ireland when we consider that it was once a of princes and chiefs each of whom was followed aud looked up to with such a spirit of enthusiasm and devoted attachment as might be naturally expected from a people remarkable for the force of their affection and their power of imagination it is not surprising that the man who in a state of society which presented to the minds of so many nothing but the records of greatness or the decay of powerful names and the of rude grandeur together with the ruin of and the of religious institutions each invested with some local or national interest â it is not surprising we say that such a man should be welcomed and listened to and honoured with a feeling far surpassing that which was awakened by the idle of a or the gorgeous dreams by fiction neither the transition of society however nor the scanty of knowledge among the irish allowed the to produce any permanent impression upon the and the consequence was that as the changes of society hurried on he and his audience were carried along with them his lore was lost in the ignorance which ever arises when a ban has been placed upon education and from the recital of the high deeds and heroic of by gone days he sank down into the humble of legends and dim traditions for such only has he been within the memory of the oldest man living and as such only do we intend to present him to our readers the most accomplished of this kind that ever came within our observation was a man called tom or tom the he was a very stout well built man about years of age with a round head somewhat bald and an forehead that argued a considerable reach of natural intellect his knowing organs were large and projected over a pair of deep set lively eyes that with tom strong of humour his voice was loud im rapid but distinct and such was the force and of his spirits added to the vehemence of his manner that altogether it was impossible to resist him his laughter was and so loud that it might be heard of a calm summer evening at an distance indeed tom possessed many qualities that rendered him a most agreeable companion he could sing a good song for instance dance a as well as any dancing master and we need not say that he could tell a good story he could also imitate a jew s harp or upon his lips with his mere fingers in such a manner that the deception was complete and it was well known that flocks of the country people used to crowd about him for the purpose of hearing his performance upon the ivy leaf which he played upon by putting it in his mouth and uttering a most melodious whistle altogether he was a man of great natural powers and possessed such a memory as the writer oâ this never knew any other human being to be gifted with he not only remembered every thing he saw or was concerned in but every thing he heard also his language when he spoke irish was clear and sometimes eloquent but when he had recourse to the english although his remained yet it was the of a man who made an use of a which he did not understand his on this account was highly ludicrous and amusing and his wit and humour original and pointed he had never received any education and was consequently completely yet he could repeat every word of s irish sermons s think well on t the seven of and the substance of s and kill s all by heart many a time have we seen read as he used to call it one of dr s sermons out of the skirt of his big coat a feat was looked upon with twice the n it would have thb irish produced had he merely said that he repeated it to read it out of the skirt of his coat i heavens how we used to look on with awe and veneration as tom in a loud rapid voice â it out of him for such was the term we gave to his recital of it his learning however was not confined to mere english and irish for tom was also classical in his way and for want of a better substitute it was said could serve mass which must always be done in latin certain it was that he could repeat the de and the dies ir bj in that language we need scarcely add that in these learned he dealt largely in false quantities and took a course for himself ,15

to make mischief preferred to keep her thoughts to herself nor was mr himself quite so intelligible to her as on first acquaintance she had thought him to be his kindness to her was and was exhibited to her in a thousand ways but there was something of reserve in his manner for which she could not account he had also moods of depression v b her suspicion were connected m cl the heir of the ages

wondered what sort of a gale it was of whose rising he stood in fear but the tone in which he had spoken of it did not encourage inquiry to see mr sad gave her great discomfort but this did not often happen she had plenty to do and plenty to think about and no apprehension for the future she enjoyed in short that of the soul â work without worry the time passed only too quickly she discovered for the first time that life was full of happiness it was her practice to get up early and work with her pen for an hour or two before breakfast what she was doing aunt jane never inquired into but only devoutly hoped that it was not a new on the works of it was how had managed to describe in so entertaining a manner and perhaps she would be able to invest the with a similar interest literature had a

and from the of the hour fancied her a shop girl on her way home or possibly a music teacher stirred by the glimpse of the refined face and even more by the carriage of the little head under the dainty hat quickened his pace to obtain another glance at her he had almost overtaken her when she stopped in front of a well lighted window of a music store the light that fell on her face revealed to him a face of unusual beauty something about her graceful pose as with her dark brows slightly she bent forward and intently the pieces of music within awakened old associations in s mind and sent him back to his boyhood at and under an impulse which he could better justify to himself than to her he did a very audacious and improper thing taking off his hat he spoke to her she had been so absorbed that for a moment she did not comprehend that it was she he was addressing then s ball as it came to her that it was she to whom this stranger was speaking she drew herself up and gave him a look of such withering scorn that felt himself shrink next second with her head high in the air she had turned without a word and sped up the street leaving feeling very cheap and subdued but that glance from dark eyes flashing with indignation had filled with a sensation to which he had long been a stranger something about the simple dress the high bred face with its fine scorn something about the air of mingled horror and contempt had suddenly through the worldly crust that had been him for some time and reaching his better self awakened an emotion that he had thought gone forever it was like a lightning flash in the darkness he knew that she had entered his life his resolution was taken on the instant he would meet her and if she were what she looked to again and his youth swept into his mind he already was conscious of a sense of protection he felt curiously that he had the right to protect her if he had addressed her might not others do the thought made his blood boil he almost wished that some one would attempt it that he might assert his right to show her what he was and thus himself in her eyes besides he must know where she lived so he followed her at a respectful distance till she ran up the steps of one of the better class of houses and disappeared within he was too far off to be able to tell which house it was that she entered but it was in the same block with s house walked the avenue that night for a long time pondering how he should find and explain his conduct to the young music teacher for a music teacher he had decided she must be the next evening too he strolled for an hour on the avenue from a distance every fair by but he saw nothing of her mrs s balls were as had once said the balls of the season only the rich and the noble were expected mrs s house was one of the great new which had been built within the past ten years upon the avenue it had cost a fortune within it was so that a work has been gotten up printed and published by of its art treasures furniture and into this for flattery could not have called it a was admitted along with some hundreds of other guests to night it was filled with not flowers exactly but with for the roses and were lost in the circles and banks formed of an infinite number of mrs a large handsome woman with good shoulders stood just inside the great drawing room she was attired and shone with diamonds until the eyes ached with her splendor behind her stood mr looking generally bored now and then he smiled and shook hands with the guests at times drawing a friend out of the line back into the rear for a chat then again into indifference or gloom was presented to mrs she only nodded to him moved on he soon discovered that a cordial greeting to a strange guest was no part of the in that society one or two acquaintances spoke to him but he was introduced to no one so he sauntered about and entertained himself observing the people the women were in their best and it was good was passing from one room to another when he became aware that a man who was standing quite still in the doorway was like himself watching the r his face was turned away but something about the compact figure and firm chin was familiar to him moved to take a look at his face it was mrs s ball he had a twinkle in his eye as he said didn t expect to see me here didn t expect to see myself here said i m one of the now and glanced down at his expensive shirt front and his evening suit with complacency wouldn t give a lot to have such a bosom as that t i think i look just as well as some of em he with a glance about him thought so too you are dressed for the part he said s look of interest inspired him to go on you see tain t like tis down with us where you know everybody and everything about him to the number of drinks he can carry well what do you do here asked who was trying to follow mr s calm eye as from time to time it swept the rooms resting here and there on a or following a hand he was evidently not merely a guest a exclaimed nodded yes the guests to ,1
around and above me even winter could not keep me from this spot for i loved its withered grass and bright green moss and silvery but most of all i loved to listen to the blast that roared amongst its boughs here i was one day indulging the full bent of my fancy until at last my thoughts broke forth in words everything in nature said i has some purpose to fulfil some power to exercise some impulse to obey but me i alone of all creation live on from day to day in a perpetual imprisonment of soul â why why was i ever animated with human life when the very worm has an existence more than mine the simplest of air may flee away and be at rest the birds have their wings to bear them to a distant land and the stream that murmurs idly at my feet through a thousand meadows finds a welcome in the bosom of the ocean at last i had scarcely uttered these words when my ear caught a rustling sound amongst the dead grass and branches on the opposite side of the brook and i saw the figure of an aged woman stooping down to fill a with water the bank was so damp and slippery that it would have been to find safe footing even for one more light and many fruitless attempts she looked up as if to see whether any one was near of whom she might ask assistance and half ashamed of my offer i crossed the stream and stooped down myself for the water there was to me a strange novelty in doing even this act of common kindness which pleased me for the moment as it brought a change and i insisted upon carrying the if her home was not far distant oh no said she with many apologies it k dose by just at the skirt of the wood you may see the smoke beside that old tree but still it is too far for you to carry such a weight and the way is not the here she hesitated for there was evidently some other reason why she did not wish me to go with her and this exciting my curiosity i with my burden which had it been imposed upon me and not of my own choosing i should have thought heavy the cottage to which our path led was beautifully situated and at first i thought it presented a perfect picture so apt are we to imagine that the cares and troubles and of life must necessarily be shut out from such picturesque and secluded on a nearer inspection however i found an air of great poverty spread over the whole and a appearance about the door that might soon have been done away by a strong and willing hand at the entrance of a plot of garden the old woman stopped and took the from my hands with many hearty thanks for the service i had done her may i not go in with you said i oh yes ma am if you please but she stopped again and looked distressed i have a poor said she for they were north country people who is just now in some trouble and will not be much pleased to see the face of a stranger but i am sure you are a kind hearted lady and you may be able to say something that will comfort her we were standing but a few paces from the door though from the small window and while we hesitated about entering i heard the following words sung in a sweet and plaintive voice by some one within who appeared to be of a listener song listen oh i listen b returning f hear ye the of hia step o er the a come again l mt one the bright are ii the hearth is swept clean in thy cottage for thee sad is the night and the morning how dreary dark ia the son when away come again d one my bosom it weary to welcome thee through the long day where ia my joy if thy is not near fa my hope if wilt not return y vainly my s would cheer me vainly my mother s bright would bam where are the that danced on the mountain where is the moonlight that slept in the where is the sparkling foam of the fountain the music that d in the whispering where are the songs i hare heard the birds when all was melody d to mine earl now every note a sad burden is bringing of spring time while winter is near where babe is thy wandering y close thy sweet eye and thee to rest ask me no more thing i would rather lull thee to sleep on this come again the bright are is thy wife and thy mother are watching for thee come again loved one thy brings beauty to nature and gladness to me oh that s her way said the woman when she s alone it her poor heart to sing these dismal if she thinks no one can hear her but come in my good lady you must not stand here in the cold the sound of our steps at the the young woman in an instant from the fireside where she had heen sitting with her in her arms there was at first a bright flash of expectation in her looks which faded away on seeing who we were and though she welcomed us in with civility and kindness i saw her turn away to wipe off the tears that were continually gathering in her eyes at last she retired into an inner room and i was at to ask her mother what was the cause of her distress it s a long story said the old woman and one that is too common for you ,7
it oppressed her made her shy and stupid she was so afraid people would expect her to live up to him but that was absurd of course brilliant men so seldom had clever children still â did i know â she would have been happier much happier if he had n t been in public life if he and she could have hidden themselves away somewhere with their books and music and she could have had it all to herself his cleverness his his immense unbounded goodness for no one knew how good he was no one but herself everybody recognized his cleverness his brilliant abilities even his enemies had to admit his extraordinary intellectual gifts and hated him the worse of course for the admission but no one no one could guess what he was at home she had heard of great men who were always giving performances in public but whose wives and daughters saw only the empty theatre with the out and the scenery in the wings but with him it was just the the portrait other way wonderful as he was in public in society she sometimes felt he wasn t doing himself justice â he was so much more wonderful at home it was like carrying a guilty secret about with her his friends his admirers would never forgive her if they found out that he kept all his best things for her i don t quite know what i felt in listening to her i was chiefly taken up with leading her on to the point i had in view but even through my personal i remember being struck by the ct that though she talked foolishly she did n t talk like a fool she was not stupid she was not one felt that her sur ce was alive with delicate points of perception and this fact coupled with her frankness flung me back on a startled of my impressions of her father he came out of the test more monstrous than ever as an ugly image reflected in clear water is made by the purity of the medium even then i felt a pang at the use to which fate had put the mountain pool of miss yard s spirit and an uneasy sense that my own reflection there was not one to linger over it was odd that i should have to deceive on one small point a girl already so cheated perhaps it was the completeness of her delusion that gave it the of a religious belief at any rate a distinct sense of discomfort tempered the satisfaction m th which a day the portrait or two later i heard firom her that her father had consented to give me a few i m afraid my scruples vanished when i got him before my he was immense and he was from my point of view he d never been done before â i was his as he talked the wonder grew his daughter came with him and i began to think she was right in saying that he kept his best for her it was n t that she drew him out or guided the conversation but one had a sense of delicate vigilance hardly more perceptible than one of those influences that give the a happier turn she was a climate i had meant to turn the talk to public affairs but it slipped toward books and art and i was faintly aware of its being kept there without undue pressure before long i saw the value of the diversion it was easy enough to get at the political the other aspect was and more instructive his daughter had described him as a scholar he wasn t that of course in any sense like most men of his type he had his knowledge as he had snatched his food from the wonder of it lay in his extraordinary power of it was the strangest instance of a mind to which had given force and without culture his learning had not educated his it was an serving to the portrait others rather than to polish himself i have said that at first sight he was immense but as i studied him he began to lessen under my scrutiny his depth was a false perspective painted on a wall it was there that my difficulty lay i had prepared too big a canvas for him his scope was considerable but it was like the reach of a â it did n t make him a great and morally he wasn t bad enough his corruption was n t sufficiently imaginative to be interesting it was not so much a means to an end as a kind of practised for its own sake like a highly developed skill in balls after all the point of view is what gives distinction to either vice or virtue a morality with ground glass windows is no than a narrow his daughter s presence â she always came with him â gave emphasis to these conclusions for where she was richest he was naked she had a deep rooted delicacy that drew color and perfume from the very centre of her being his sentiments good or bad were as as his thus her planned as i guessed with the tender intention of him of making him accessible in detail to my dazzled â this pious design in fact defeated itself she made him appear at his best but she that the portrait best by her for the man was vulgar to the core vulgar in spite of his force and magnitude thin hollow a and plaster â did she suspect it i think not â then he was wrapped in her faith the papers oh their charges were set down to political and the only people she saw were his on or the fashionable set who had taken him up for their amusement besides she would ,11
down to the now there was nothing in all the world the divine sex that van loved better than errands of this kind so just stopping to take a dinner and to his side his bottle well charged with he issued from the that looked out upon what is at present called broad way sounding as usual a farewell strain that rung in echoes through the winding streets of new â alas never more were they to be by

stream â scarce had he over when he was observed to struggle violently as if with the spirit of the waters â instinctively he put his trumpet to his mouth and giving a vehement blast â sunk for ever to the bottom the potent of his trumpet like the horn of the renowned when in the glorious field of rung far and wide through the country alarming the neighbours round who hurried in amazement to the

his table who good fish and hates the devil such was the end of van â a man deserving of a better fate he lived and soundly like a true and jolly bachelor until the day of his death but though he was never married yet did he leave behind some two or three dozen children in different parts of the country â fine little from whom if legends speak true and they are not apt to lie did descend the innumerable race of who people and defend this country and who are paid by the people for keeping up a constant alarm â and making them miserable would that they inherited the worth as they do the

the heart and are nourished by its warmest current as some pilgrim while the tempest at s through his locks and dreary night is gathering around stretched cold and lifeless his faithful dog â the sole companion of his who had shared his solitary meal and so often licked his h nd in humble gratitude â so did the hearted hero of the plate the end of his faithful he had been the humble attendant of

moment when cur seemed from his side â this â peter â this was the moment to try thy fortitude and this was the moment when thou indeed shine forth â peter the the glare of day had long the horrors of the last stormy night still all was dull and gloomy the late jovial hid his face behind clouds peeping out now and then for an instant as if anxious yet fearful to see what was going on in his favourite city this was morning when the great peter was to give his reply to the summons of the already was he with his council sitting in im state brooding over the fate of his favourite and anon boiling with indignation aa the insolence of his flashed upon his mind while in this state of irritation a arrived in all haste from the subtle governor of him fr b a in the most affectionate and disinterested manner to surrender the province and the dangers and to which a refusal would subject him â what a moment was this to intrude advice upon a man who never took advice in his whole life â the fiery old governor strode up and down the chamber with a vehemence that made the of his to with awe â railing at his unlucky fate that thus made him the constant butt of subjects and just at this ill chosen juncture the who were now completely on the watch and had heard of the arrival of mysterious came marching in a resolute body into the room with a of and at their heels and abruptly

that he also had never had brother or sister and it gave a sort of excuse for the kiss which he pressed on their marriage bond her forehead pushing back her hair for the purpose she continued to hold one of his hands and the sensation was not disagreeable but after a little while a sense of the came over him and he made an excuse to leave her for the present as he was crossing the hall he met one of the servants who handed him some letters that had just arrived one of them was from his father and this he read first i am feeling much better of late and perhaps i shall yet live for years i think it is on account of my pleasure at your prospects which is the nearest thing to my heart i have seen a member of your firm who says you have made a marked success on your trip then i receive a call daily from mrs or when the latest condition of the forms the main subject of conversation just think how near it is september ah you are a lucky young dog with such a bride in store so young so pretty so good and a thing not to be despised an to a comfortable fortune i need not caution you to be most in your conduct the remainder of your journey for a clean record is the best present a man can bring to his wife temptations must fail before the prospect of this superb creature in your arms such a short time away says you have written but seldom but i tell her some of the letters may have been lost you have moved about so much write a little oftener to both of us but if there is time for only one write to she will come over and tell me she has heard from you and i shall know you are well and safe felt a of conscience as he read the loving words he had not written to his father as often as he ought since since especially the date of his meeting with captain rivers and his daughter to their marriage bond he had written not more than twice a month and he had done little then beside telling of the scenes he had passed through much after the manner of a newspaper correspondent not once had he given way to an expression of affection nor had he alluded in the remotest degree to their engagement or approaching marriage in her answers she had made no reference to these things either but it was not to be expected she would do so when he had so avoided the subject resolved that he would write more frequently in accordance with his father s request both to him and to the news of his parent s improved health gave him great delight and he reflected with pleasure on the to the time when they would again look each other in the face as soon as he had written and his replies to the firm and to his father mr escorted miss rivers to the train which already bore the body of the dead soldier and they set out for the funeral took place on the day after their arrival the hot weather in that country making impossible the simple military service was read the salute fired by the and the soil of egypt began its work miss rivers bore the strain better than he could have expected she leaned upon him in everything not only did she commit to his care the disposition of her father but of herself she put her slender purse in his hand with the utmost confidence saying that he would find the least expensive route for her to take in the tickets for england believing that a diversion was the best thing for her he began on the second day after the funeral to take her with him in his drives about together they saw their marriage bond the wonderful works of long extinct men which have made this vicinity the for of all lands together they strolled through the ancient the and the beautiful new quarter fringed by the old laid out like a piece of paris itself their conversation during these days was held in a low key and those who met them realized that some recent

way home the to on some of the smaller lines were much lower than those which sailed direct for there connecting with the across the continent of europe though the latter were by far more he explained the difference to margaret who answered that she would leave it entirely to him if he was going in the same direction she added with charming she would certainly prefer that route by all means there was no need to spend a long time at the port from which the start for would be made a couple of days would suffice for all the sights at that point so the intervening time was passed at which above

he replied i ll suit her to the part of a scruple here our broke up with a flash of merriment and we did nothing but jest all the rest of the day dined with us and when in the evening he thought of returning came into the parlor to make a proposition which had the effect to retain our guest with us all that night the incident that followed will require a chapter to itself chapter when came into the parlor he pulled off his hat and made a profound bow and then advanced to the back of ned s chair where in a low and orderly tone of voice he made the following grave and interesting disclosure namely that the boys â meaning some of the other who belonged to the plantation â had found out what had been disturbing the poultry yard for some past that it was not a as had been given out but nothing less than a large old that had been traced to a tree over by the river about a mile distant that the boys had him to use s own term by some feathers near the tree and when they looked into the hollow they could see his eyes shining like he said they had been trying to screw him out by thrusting up a long stick cut with a fork at the end an approved method of bringing out and from their holes and much in practice in the country and it in his hair but that this design was abandoned under the supposition that perhaps master edward would like to hunt him in the regular way ned professed a suitable concern in the intelligence but inquired of whether he as an old thought it lawful to hunt an at this i i i negro to and afterwards with a wise look to le several cases in which he considered a hunt at the altogether with usage he that in general were not to be followed till q time because they were always when that but when they couldn t get they were apt to attack the young fowls and out their throats is good law to hunt any sort of creature when he was be doing mischief to the plantation but even then with a and nevertheless that young and especially a which has ig ones than most other beasts he thought they ought lone until their appropriate time this however was lie that was known to be engaged in and moreover was shocking fat and therefore whole considered him as a lawful subject of b sagacious of the question and to the the had arrived at ned could oppose no he therefore replied that he was entirely he had taken a correct view of the subject f mr and mr could be prevailed upon land nothing would be more agreeable than the pro re unanimous on the proposition agreed to to the until the next morning and it ed that we should be by when the to set out on the expedition then detailed f proceeding a watch was to be set near the hen were to be kept out of the way lest they might the enemy unawares and destroy him without a to be given of his approach and one or two of those f i on the watch were to frighten him away and after allowing him time enough to get back to the woods the dogs were to be put npon the trail and to pursue him until he was having announced this the old servant bowed again and left the room saying that it would be pretty late before we should be called out because it was natural to these animals to wait until people went to bed and that a was one of the things alive midnight arrived without a summons from our leader the family had long since retired to rest and we began to fear that our was to end in disappointment we had taken sion of the in the hall and had almost dropped asleep when about half past twelve came through the back door and told us in a mysterious whisper that the upon the poultry yard had just been detected in his visit that big ben for so one of the was to distinguish him from little ben had been out and saw the animal close under the fence in the neighborhood of the upon this intelligence we rose and followed the domestic to the spot here were assembled six or seven of the men and boys who were clustered into a group at a short distance from the poultry yard within a hundred paces the tall figure of big ben was discerned in dim outline proceeding cautiously across a field until he had beyond our view a adventure is always attended with a certain show of mystery the presence of darkness up in every mind an indefinite sense of fear â faint but still sufficient to throw an interest around trivial things to which we are strangers in the the little assembly of we had just joined were waiting in noiseless reserve for some report from ben and upon our arrival were expressing in low and wary whispers their conjectures as to the c the game had taken or their separate experience as to the habits of the animal it was a night and the obscure and vault above us showed its thousands of stars with a brilliancy unusual at this season a breeze swept through the darkness and fluttered he neighboring foliage with an alternately increasing and falling murmur some of the younger stood with no clothing but coarse shirts and shivering amongst the crowd and every now and then breaking out into exclamations in a pitch of voice that called down the reproof of their elders ned all to be silent and to seat themselves upon the ground and while we remained in this ,10
time to learn something of them and this would have proved of value to me yet i am thankful that had not yet been thrust into our rural common schools to knot the brains and the time of those who should be learning something of positive and practical utility before the spring of opened father had taken a job of clearing fifty acres of wild land a mile north of our cot and here he and his sons were employed save in winter for the next two years tlie work was rugged and but the land had been with yellow pine a thousand years before â as a hundred giant trunks long since but not yet wholly back to dust this was by a forest of white pines of which hundreds were still standing mostly lifeless while a large number lay prone and dead though the trunks were mainly sound black ash in abundance formed a later and generally living growth though a fierce which swept over this whole region during a great four years before we saw it had devoured much and killed more of the forest but increased the of etc which we were required to dispose of when we first it the snow was just going and the water and were knee deep we were all indifferent when compared with those who usually with great forests and the job looked so formidable that travellers along the which skirted our task were accustomed to halt and comfort us with that we boys would be grown men before we saw the end of it but cutting trees and bushes up great into drawing them together rolling up and burning great heaps of logs saving out here and there a log that would do to saw digging out rotten pines from the boil wherein they had themselves so that they might dry sufficiently to bum and burning brush and rotten or worthless sticks and home such wood as served for fuel we until the job was done when i could have begun another just like it and managed so as not to more than two thirds of the r we expended on this and now if any one has a great tract of land to clear of trees logs and bushes i fancy that i might give him hints worth considering n b â i work for pay we liad been farmers of the poorer class in new we took rank with day in we had lived freely though not much less in our earlier home w e were compelled to observe a the bread of our class in this section was almost exclusively made of e â indian corn being little grown on the clay soil of western â and though there are always about six women alive who know how to make of the best bread ever tasted our mother was not one of these recollections of a busy life and never learned their admirable art then the clay itself with the weather from mire to rock is not well adapted to bare feet while the detestable canada which every road and almost every field in are not to of temper or propriety of speech having the sharp of these dug out of my feet with needles was long my daily terror and my nightly torture the tough with which their rough experiences had covered our naked feet rendering the of the more laborious and painful than any soft footed person can realize i have never since been able to stiff clay at their full value a ledge eighty rods east of the from which we worked westward afforded us good spring water and supplied us also with whereof we killed some which might have proved to us boys as we worked among the brush and weeds had they caught the idea still clearing land is pleasant work especially when you have a hundred heaps of logs and brush burning at once of a dark windy night while ten or twenty acres of fallen leafy timber on fire at once affords a magnificent spectacle we were to have had per acre with the use of a team and half the wood suitable for timber and fuel and though even in those days was not large pay for two years work of a man and two boys we were well satisfied in the event however mr died before we had effected a settlement when his estate was declared and we were out of a part of our pay our third year in was spent two miles farther west where we inhabited and worked a little place known as father ran a neighboring saw mill on shares as he twelve hours on and twelve off with a partner i insisted on being his but i think once working from noon till midnight my ambition and

results first the season was wet till the of june and our com planted in mortar encountered a brick like crust when it undertook to come up and unable to pierce or break it pushed under it for two inches or so until we dug off the crust and introduced the pale imprisoned shoots to next came a long summer of intense and our fields so that tlie made no serious impression on their rock like masses

the founder of an order and of many who lived side by side in the same body the constant associate of the saint tried to her to herself and two pictures in her by she deep eager passionate eyes and a frail exhausted body borne along easily by the soul and doing the work of the soul in the second picture there were the sam eyes the same wasted body but the expression was quite different the saint s manner was the happiest manner and thought of the privilege of such companionship and she envied those who had walked with her hearing her speak the little pond at her feet was full of fair reflections of the sky and trees and the idea of life lay on the pages of the book even as fair in itself it was and vague but on the pages of the book it floated clear and distinct she asked if any of the lived a life of that intense inward rapture which st deemed essential if a sister were to be allowed to remain in the of st joseph at and the coincidence of tjie names gave her pause this s patron saint was st joseph and she sought for some resemblance between the mother and st she wondered if she were a towards which of the would her personal sympathies incline would she love better sister or sister mary john it might be mother mary it be one of the three there was not one among the others likely to interest her in the least she tried to imagine this friendship it assumed a vague shape and then dissolved in the distance but would the reverend mother this friendship or would it be promptly cut down to the root according to the advice of st her thoughts pursued their way now and then as they leaped out of the soul s only the of the broke the stillness of the garden and startled at a sudden sound she rose in time to see a shadowy shape sinking with a motion of fl amid the weeds that she should be living in a that she should have repented of her sins that the should leap and fall back with strange sound filled her with the vague autumn blue expressed some vague yearning some indistinct the air was like crystal the leaves were falling we have of the outer forms of things but that is all we know of the only we are sure of is what is in by we know the difference between right and wrong he stood for a long time at the edge of the fish pond gazing into the depths then she walked exalted overcome by the mystery of things she seemed to walk upon air the world was a thrill with spiritual significance all was symbol and exaltation her past life shrank to a tiny speck and she knew that she had been happy only since she had been in the ah that little chapel haunted by prayers i it breathed prayer in that chapel contemplation was far off she had prayed there as she had never prayed before and she wondered if she should attribute the difference in her prayers to the chapel or to herself she had always felt in a dumb instinctive way that to her at least everything depended on her she had been now a long while the explanation seemed to have come to her yes it is by denial of the instinct that we become religious as she passed through the orchard she caught sight of the strange little person whom she had seen in chapel with a pile of prayer books beside her and who always wore something blue whether skirt or she had met her in the garden before but she had hurried away her eyes fixed on the ground mother had spoken of a miss a simple minded person who had been sent by her family to the to be looked after by the and concluded that it must be she but at that moment other thoughts engaged her attention and she lingered in the orchard returning slowly by st peter s walk as she passed the temple or summer house she was taken by a desire to examine it and there she found miss she was seated on the floor engaged so thought in a game of patience that was only how she could account for miss s consternation and fear at seeing her but what she had taken for cards were pious pictures stood in the doorway and for the first time had an opportunity of seeing what miss was really like it was difficult to say whether her face was ugly or pretty the features were not amiss â it was the expression vague and dim like that of an animal that puzzled please let me help you to pick up your pictures miss did not answer and feared for a by ment that she had offended her won t you let me help you to pick up your pictures yes she said you may help me to pick them up but you must be very quick but why must i be quick are you in such a very great hurry miss seemed uncertain of her own thoughts and to her asked her if she would not like to walk with her in the orchard oh she said looking at â it was a sort of child like curiosity i dare not go into the orchard to day i brought these pictures to keep him from me i know that he is about who is about i m afraid he might hurt me but who would hurt you well she said cautiously perhaps he d be afraid to come near me to day and she glanced at her frock but i m sure he s about did you see any one as you came through the bushes ,3
further when the owner makes declaration of the value of his goods by what means shall the of the detect fraud shall it be by the goods at his own risk provided he will give the third part of the price added to that at which they were entered this plan also would be unjust and it proves besides that a fraud of from fifteen to twenty per cent may be practised with in the application of the law established upon the measure or value do not then constitute a sufficient to domestic industry and it now us to inquire in being governed by the weight of goods we should find the same in convenience in duties by the finer of the loom which are only the use of luxury pay necessarily very little in comparison with the articles which are destined for tiie wants of the most numerous of society inasmuch as the manual labour is next to in the latter and it almost the entire value of the former so that such a would prejudice the interests of the greatest number and be contrary to every principle laid down it is necessary however to adopt some course amidst these difficulties and i think that in all the different methods proposed value weight and meagre we might ascertain the which should be paid by each article in a way the least already the collection by weight has been established upon the greatest number of articles which we import such as produce iron preparations c and it only remains for us to apply to productions of the loom the combined plan proposed supposing then the present object to be to fix the rate of duties upon of the loom we take a yard of each of the two kinds of stuff which constitute the highest and lowest extremes in value of the articles from the same material and determine accurately the weight of those of equal length and we then take the inter weight by which to fix the duty in this way we establish a which embraces every quality and we take care to the duties upon fine in such a way as to cover the manual labour thus supposing the same kind of stuff presents ten different qualities and that the medium would be fixed at ten die finest could pay twenty and j on twenty although the would pay but five we might also establish the duties upon the same basis and only determine the medium weight of all the qualities of cloth of the same general nature by comparing those of equal length and breadth the might be fixed upon this me and raised or lowered to proportion it to the superior or inferior qualities after this manner if one kind of cot ton stuff or cloth present five different qualities in weight and value and we should establish a medium duty of five the duty might be lowered for articles and increased for those of finer quality thus covering the manual labour by having regard to the value and of the stuff it would require but experience to distinguish the different kinds of articles of the same general nature and the after having ascertained the kind would have only to determine the weight of one yard of this stuff to apply the duty it ought further to be observed that in the productions derived from the manufacture of wool of linen of cotton c and establishing the duties for each class the is imperfect since it cannot be applied and varied according to the qualities which are comprehended within the same kind of manufacture and consequently affords an unequal protection to industry this system is bad in that it in the same rate of duties which though of the same general nature differ very much in value and in the cost of their manufacture it is sufficient to establish this position to take for instance jn dividing them according to these principles we shall make three classes first fine second light fine thirds coarse s in the first we may include broad fine with long nap of the holland fashion c the second will contain the the royal i f striped and e y in imitation of the third will comprehend swan skins i knit for the c but how are we to distinguish and place in each division the qualities of cloth which belong to it when these qualities are so numerous that differ in value from three to one hundred and admitting this to be possible do not the qualities in the same class vary almost to all the which do not ex thirty per ell in value would be as coarse which exceed this price would be received as fine thus would be with the same duty as the first quality of cloth ip and all over the thirty would pay as much as that from the finest spanish wool or the italian this method is attended moreover with the very great disadvantage of the interests of the people because the productions which they want are as as those which in commerce are of triple r value what we have just said of may be applied to the different of cotton linen and silk and i see no other way to establish a correct of duties but upon the principles here laid down when government oppressed by necessity thinks itself compelled to lay a duty upon the of a material which is essential to the support of any particular kind of industry it ought to repay the duty to the of the article without which all competition in foreign would be impossible this return ought be made without any other formality than to determine the quantity of imported material used in the ture of the article when this material is not a production of some of the of by the help of t tr on our soil it should be sufficient to ,6
horses were also taken oflf and four oxen obtained to draw the wagon out of the drift and on to the changing place not far distant soon all were on board again â all as good as before except that the were wet on both sides and the seats had rather a feeling and we went on merrily as ever â meeting few decided obstacles for the next twelve miles â to the second changing place north so far we had made good time in of wind and weather and now said the driver you may expect to see some bad going the testimony was confirmed by others but we did not need their assurance two miles more were got over pretty well one bad place being avoided by letting down the fence and making a through the field but soon we were brought to a dead halt again the horses were in a rather profound drift the wagon was stuck and no resource remained but to beat up the neighborhood for oxen to draw it on while the passengers went ahead in quest of dinner the of the number weighing good two hundred who had already twice taken his own portrait by a flying leap into a snow drift and had received some severe and a hard in the later operation when he narrowly missed breaking a leg in clearing the wagon alone lingered behind to pick up some bits of rides between the worst snow of which i think there were a hundred within that next two miles yet the wagon was by six oxen got through or around them somehow in a little more than two hours â the horses following behind and coming through with a beaten and sorry look i had no idea it could be done so soon by an hour dinner at in a hurry and all aboard again and to we were enabled to take the rain sitting instead of walking for nearly au the time some had to be walked over of course some snow had to be away from before the wheels once or twice we had to take hold and help the wagon through a drift that need not have been so deep so far as any practical utility was regarded in its construction and twice more our solid friend was half thrown half jumped into the snow as the wagon up on one side and seemed intent on going over the last time one arm went through the drift into about two feet of water and he already and sore was on the point of losing temper the others were more or rather more lucky generally making a clean jump and and right end up finally at p m we drove rapidly into â fifty good miles from â and found warm rooms and various comforts awaiting us that evening was a little a bide across the np hill but since the hearers did not audibly complain i sha n t i thought the village dancing school at our hotel ought to have broken up at midnight considering that some of us were to be called for the stage at a m but the young folks seemed to enjoy it to a much later hour and if their parents don t object i probably should be quiet still i do say that dancing â which ought to be a innocent and approved for all â is made with the grave and devout by the late hours to which mere in years are kept up by it in hot and crowded rooms whence they are suddenly transferred when utterly exhausted to the cold and their homes it was not the creaking of that fiddle the heavy of feet on the ball room floor and the rattle of my door latch in consequence till some time this morning that put this into my head but these served to confirm me in my earlier conviction a ride across the washington monday december it was o clock on saturday morning when our reached iu two days from tliat was a bad of western management i had promised at home to be here the evening before the opened and it was essential that i should be punctual i ought to have stopped but one day instead of two at i ought to have travelled by land from that city and so been at six hours sooner tlie boat ought and might have been there some hours earlier but here it was o clock and the stages to connect at with the and train next morning had all been gone some four hours no other train would leave till monday morning â twenty four hours later i jumped ashore with my baggage and sped to the stage office one of the members of for self and company got there at the same moment and spoke can you send ns through to in time for to train o sir it i too late the returned to report progress not the impossibility of driving miles in hours even over a road with of good horses every ten or twelve miles i hung on and had the resident proprietor summoned i put the question to him varied aa follows will money put us through to in time for to morrow s cars yes money will â money enough how much if five of you will pay for a fall stage nine seats and twenty dollars extra you be taken through i hurried down to the boat in search of the but looked it over without finding them at last i discovered one of the mr r call your friends we can be taken to in season for about twenty dollars each he would not listen â said it could not be done â he had tried it once and faded i suspect he did not try the extra price no cure no pay he turned away and ,8
is a theme that has been used by a thousand and it seemed impossible that there could be anything essentially new in such an experience does the case differ so much then i inquired from those that have already been made the subject of romance in every particular replied my friend at least it is totally unlike anything have seen in print not only this but i believe it unique as an actual occurrence if you wish i will outline it to you my curiosity was now fairly alive i begged mr to begin at once and not to content himself with an outline either but to give me the fullest details of which he was possessed he answered that this would need considerable time and i said i was at his disposal even if it took all night u i cannot tell he said whether it will require five hours or ten to give you the details i have gathered they are in a somewhat state in my mind and will have to be put together slowly and as i hinted in the first place the most interesting part beginning with a mystery o die matter is still veiled in mystery perhaps you will be able to the hidden threads and complete the story to your own satisfaction but certainly none of miss s friends have yet been able to learn the least thing beyond what she has chosen to tell them i asked if he would permit me a few questions in advance of his narrative by all means he said as many as you please to begin with how did you learn the facts you are about to relate from george mrs and miss mainly was the response the young lady s father made a of me in many things her mother i also knew to some extent then i have talked by the hour with drew and his wife with dr and mrs you will hear more of these people presently that is miss has discussed matters with me as freely as if i were her brother or even her sister and the baby miss s baby knows me as well as a young gentleman of his age could be expected to do and has jumped and in my arms within the last three weeks i was silent for a moment then i remarked in a subdued tone that such cases were very sad especially when they happened among the better educated and more classes they made one doubt whether the world was not growing worse instead of better miss would not agree with you said quickly she is the happiest young of mother i ever knew in her sweet face there is not a single tinge of regret i stared at my friend in astonishment and she is an mother i exclaimed precisely then her reason must be i asserted certainly not in the ordinary sense he answered aside from this matter of the child she appears as sensible as any other healthy girl she in nearly everything else to the prevailing fashions she dresses for instance in the usual mode she looks lives and acts like the rest of her sex so far as i can see her signature on a business paper is never disputed she keeps to herself a good deal but that is because the majority of women do not like to associate with one who has proved her belief in such or as she would call them advanced doctrines however does not care for society her time is more pleasantly spent with her child whom she passionately sane why yes no jury would question her ability to care for herself her boy or her property i waited a moment and then inquired who was the father of the infant that is the mystery said from the little we have learned it appears that the man is dead dr drew this from her with a few other particulars of little importance during a few hours when she stood in imminent danger of dying and she has never denied or modified her statements the only trouble is she will not add the least syllable to them beginning with a she does not appear to mourn him very deeply i suggested no not as a woman would mourn a husband or a lover the doctor says the tears came into her eyes when she mentioned that he was no more but she has not put on either literally or she sings smiles well and acts quite the opposite of broken hearted to this i remarked after reflection that her conduct was not to be wondered at judged from one a fellow of that kind did not deserve to be very sincerely regretted a fellow of what kind asked one who would deceive a girl and then desert her my companion smiled but this man did nothing of the sort said he did nothing of the sort i echoed did not deceive or desert her neither the one thing nor the other that is a riddle i replied nothing but the simple truth miss freely admits to all who care to discuss the matter with her that if there were any deception it was on her part not his i nodded oh it was miss who deceived and deserted her lover something of that nature assented with another laugh but let me say that if you keep on at this rate you will take all the interest out of my story it is a girl s way rather than a man s out of to through the pages of a book and read the last chapter first i admitted the truth of the observation and said there were only one or two other things that i wanted to know before settling myself into the attitude of a patient and listener i presume you will tell me next i added that the father of miss ,5

revenge by any method however foul to us it toy appear the troops continued at work on the on the th of october the council was held with the indians the are a numerous of indians once the most numerous on the and probably quite to any of them now they are certainly die most powerful in our neighbourhood they are divided into four bands the great on la river about miles above its mouth the reside on die s fork of la river within miles of the great and the republic ao called from their on the republican fork of the river from whence they were driven by their wars with the and and they now reside near the great the fourth band appears to be very little known to the they on the red river the bands near this post as near as we can judge om muster the following number of warriors the great too the â â the are within three days march of the bluff when these bands were visited by the late general in the and the were at war they are now in a state of profound peace and as the three bands live so near to each other they may be considered as one nation the are now at war with the and their war excursions are very fire carried into the of the latter from whence they procure a great

child and that s a spoilt one is he not very delicate inquired i noticed a pretty but very fragile looking boy looking out of the window of the dining room when we arrived that s him yes he is fragile enough no wonder when he with grown up people and has a bottle of wine all to himself how shocking i exclaimed what sort of wine oh i don t know it puts one out of patience even to look at him though of course it is his father s fault and how old is this terrible gentleman inquired mr carelessly seven â though he might be seventy from his old fashioned ways i meant his father oh he â well i m sure i don t know he looks as brown and withered and taking his manners into account as rough as a what do you call em â things you have at â a however are sweet inside observed that s just what mr says his notion is that ill health makes the man but that he has a kind heart but there as i once ventured to tell him perhaps mr you want to get some of mr s in which case you will be disappointed since every single one of them will go to little that was very frank and like yourself observed mt with gentle approval but who is mt no one to speak of a friend of mr w va a from a thorn in the same house with him a man of good and breeding but who has thrown all the chances of life away and himself it you have known such cases yourself dare say mr yes the word was snapped out sullenly like the closing of a spring lock to the ears of his visitor the tone seemed only to express contempt in sympathy with her own for all such ne wells but knew that the conversation had somehow become distasteful to her father as usual therefore she instantly came to his relief what is it this mr has done which is so dreadful p she inquired it was natural to her to feel pity for persons in misfortune even when rather than indignation and a desire for further well instead of entering a profession like every other young man in his position the poor creature took to writing â writing stories but if he didn t write other people s names on said laughing which would be a very wicked sort of story why should he not there is no harm in it my dear young lady of course there is no harm in it said mrs gravely â that is as an amusement but as i was just now remarking about painting had the happiness to find your father agreed with me the calling of letters is not one to be undertaken seriously by â well i don t say gentlemen because i don t wish to be personal and this young man apart from i pursuit is very â by persons who have been bom to better things what do you say mr my dear madam it is unnecessary for me to say anything you have expressed my own sentiments in the happiest manner it must be however that a man may do what he likes so long as he remains single the evil is when a woman attempts to gain a position for herself by any other means save those which are in accordance with common and â the fitness of things we shall have the pleasure of seeing you at the table i conclude p for mrs had risen to go oh certainly i then i shall have the honour of introducing you to the professor i he is the hills just now in pursuit t p v a n o â r a i in a inn aa under my wing and with a pleasant nod that would have been somewhat familiar but that it was by a certain and swan like movement which her on momentous occasions mrs swam out of the room a very remarkable woman observed mr when the door had closed behind her but my dear papa said hesitatingly she did not strike me as being â quite a lady she didn t she was my and a d xi n t find a descent fault where there is no pretence i confined myself to saying she was remarkable she is a woman of character and has already been of the greatest use to us by giving us the du pays you think it was wrong of me to her brains and especially to lead her to believe she had made such a favourable impression on us p yet she came here to ours and to produce that veiy impression do you suppose she really came to give me a you may take my word for it she has forgotten all about it and in that case i am glad it was or we should perhaps have made acquaintance with it in the form of some at the table chapter vi â a descent it was soon made known to the guests at the that the honourable george and his daughter would honour the with their presence but what was by no means so certain and was among the great powers with considerable energy and bitterness was where were they to sit from the very earliest ages this question has always been a supreme one and very much to my content for when i read of the eminent specimens of humanity who have made a point of this matter of and behold living ones concerning themselves about it and reflect that i myself don t care one button where i sit provided the chair is comfortable and not in a draught i cannot but experience some sensation of superiority to my mind there are few things so curious as to ,12

miss the assistant nodded an impatient assent and at her mistress curiously but while tiie children were present she could only watch her employer s face and strive to read it and unconscious of the scrutiny sat idly talking of the skirt that was finished the of the needles sounded as music in her ears and she abandoned herself to all sorts of soft and floating not for years had she known what it was to take her fill of rest her thoughts swayed now on one side and then on the other as as flowers and hid themselves in the luxurious current of idleness which loosely around her the afternoon passed delightfully full of ease and pleasant quiet telling them how let had gone the night before of miss s spirited singing of the song of joe s splendid scene of s success in the so eagerly did she speak of them that one would have thought she herself had received the applause she described and the little sucked staring the while with interested but could not manage to see mr that evening or the

morning and in â thousand different ways did these thoughts turn and twist in s brain as she sat sewing opposite in the this young woman had made up her mind that there was something between the stage manager and her employer and it irritated her when said she had not seen him for the last two days was not very successful either in theatrical news from if she s going to be close with me i ll show her that two can play at that game and she answered that she had not noticed any limp but mrs told he so badly that she felt sure be must have met with an accident which was she to believe mother of

he had done this on purpose to avoid her or whether it was the result of chance passed the morning in considering she had hitherto succeeded in completely their fall amid the hot the memory of it now up in her mind and certain coarse details that she had forgotten to to her with a singular deaf to a conversation she sat sullenly sewing even to go down to the shop to attend when mrs called from below that there was a customer waiting about three o clock mrs s voice was beard come down there is in the shop passing round the counter she found herself face to face with a weu woman i was

tied across and yon will want a hood and cloak we have some very nice ones at two pounds ten bat perhaps you would not like to give so much without replying to this question the lady asked to see the articles referred to and then beneath the men s that hung just above their beads the two women talked with many genuine airs of mystery and covert the lady spoke of her fears of how much she wished the next fortnight was over of her husband of how long she had been married she was mrs wood the s wife in said she knew her customer s shop perfectly and assumed a sad expression when in her turn sh was asked if she had any children on her replying in the negative mrs wood said with a sigh of that people were possibly just as well without them it was at this moment that mr entered and tried to sweep away and to hide np the things that were on the counter mrs wood was mildly embarrassed and with a movement of retiring she attempted to resume the conversation very well mrs she said i quite

into and dying as it well deserved for this to its own higher spirit where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts the town aged and creep a field alas what faith is requisite to bear up against

world and having nobody but myself to care for i live very much at my ease and fare every day as for poetry i have given it up notwithstanding that doctor â as the reader of course knows â has placed me at a fair elevation among our minor on the strength of my pretty little volume published ten years ago as regards human progress in spite of my irrepressible over the reminiscences let them believe in it who can and aid in it who choose if i could earnestly do either it might be all the better for my comfort as once told me i lack a purpose how strange he was ruined by an of the very same the

the excursion into but s indulgence did not altogether please him he began to suspect it and to doubt if he had acted wisely in not ordering joseph away from for was him him of all that he valued in this world his son and it seemed to him a little later in the day as he closed his that he had come to be disregarded in his own house and he thought he would have liked much better to stay away to dine in the counting house urging a press of business the first thing he would be the hated name was never off the boy s lips he talked of nothing else but and hebrew and greek and the learned jews whom he met at s house dan sat looking into the dusk asking himself if his bargain were not that his son should learn the greek language but not greek literature which is full of he said to himself and he returned home determined to raise the point but joseph told him and he thought rather abruptly that it was only through greek literature that one could learn greek in â the spoken language was a dialect it may have been that joseph perceived that praise of caused his father to a little and â curious to observe the effect â he spoke more of than he would have done otherwise and laid an accent on his master s learning and related incidents in which his master appeared to great advantage causing his father much perplexity and pain of mind till at last unable to bear the torture any longer he said â the words slipped from him â you re no better than a little i and unable to contain himself he rushed from the room leaving joseph and to discuss his vehemence and discover motives which he hoped would not include the right one but afraid the brook that he had betrayed his jealousy of he returned and to his mother and son he began to speak of the duty of the pupil to the master telling joseph he must submit himself to in everything by representing as one in full authority he hoped to overcome his influence and before many months had passed over a different accent was notable in joseph s voice when he spoke of but he continued with him for two more years and it was then that dan set himself to devise plans to end his son s studies in hebrew and greek joseph knows now all that can teach him and it is high time that i took him in hand and taught him his trade but though determined to rid himself of he felt he must proceed gently if possible in with his mother he must wait for an occasion and while he was watching for one it fell out that joseph wearied of and went to his father saying that he had learnt hebrew and could speak greek so there was no use in his returning to any more at first his parents could only think that he had quarrelled with but it was not so they soon discovered that he had merely become tired of him â a change that a capricious mind a growing boy is full of fancies said an explanation that dan deemed sufficient and he was careful not to speak against lest he should turn his son s thoughts back on greek literature or greek philosophy which is more even than the literature he did not dare to ask joseph to come down to the counting house afraid lest by trying to influence him in one direction he might influence him in the opposite direction he deemed it better to leave everything to fate and while putting his trust in god dan applied himself to on the young man s character and his tastes which seemed to have taken a sudden turn for to his father s surprise joseph had begun to put questions to him about the sale of fish and to speak of visiting the brook s and with a view to establishing branch houses â of their business his father while of this plan pointed out that and being themselves on the coast of the sea could never be as good customers as inland cities sea fish being considered he thought to lake he had been doing it is true a fair trade with but whereas it was impossible to reckon on it seemed to him that their industry might be extended in many other directions and delighted with the change that had come over his son he said that he would have tried long ago to extend his business if he had had knowledge of the greek language he spoke of and proposed to joseph that he should go there and establish a for salt fish as soon as he had mastered all the details of the trade which would be soon a very little application in the counting house would be enough for a clever fellow like joseph as he said these words his eyes met s and as soon as joseph left the room she asked him if he believed that joseph would settle down to the selling of salt fish a question which was not agreeable to dan who was at that moment settling himself into the conviction that joseph had begun to an for trade that he himself did not acquire till many years older causing him to flame up as might be expected

ca as in or tne man out run m a nd deeper channels his pride tions his are all directed towards fewer objects but the wounds inflicted on them are severe and furnish motives of hostility which we cannot sufficiently appreciate where a community is also limited in number and forms one great family as in an indian tribe the injury of an individual is the injury of the whole and the sentiment of vengeance is almost diffused one council fire is sufficient for the discussion and arrangement of a plan of here all the fighting men and eloquence and superstition combine to the minds of the the orator their martial and they are wrought up to a kind of religious desperation by the visions of the prophet and the an instance of one of those sudden arising from a motive peculiar to the indian character is in an old record of the early settlement of the of had the monuments of the dead at and had the grave of the s mother of some skins with which it had been decorated the indians are remarkable for the reverence which they entertain for the of their kindred tribes that have passed traits of indian character generations from the of their ancestors when by chance they have been travelling in the vicinity have been known to turn aside from the high way and guided by wonderfully accurate tradition have crossed the country for miles to some buried perhaps in woods where the bones of their tribe were deposited and there v have passed hours in silent meditation influenced by this sublime and holy feeling the whose mother s tomb had been gathered his men together and addressed them in the following beautifully simple and pathetic a curious specimen of indian eloquence and an in ance of filial piety in a savage when last the glorious light of all the sky was underneath this globe and birds grew silent i began to settle as my custom is to take repose before mine eyes were fast closed i saw a vision at which my spirit was much troubled and at that sight a spirit cried aloud behold my son whom i have cherished see the breasts that gave thee the hands that thee warm and fed thee oft thou forget to take revenge of those wild people who have my monument in a manner our and honourable customs see now the s grave lies like the common people by an race thy mother traits of indian character doth complain and thy aid against this people have newly on our land if this be suffered i shall not rest quiet in my everlasting habitation this said the spirit vanished and i all in a sweat not able scarce to speak began to get some strength and recollect my spirits that were and determined to demand your counsel and assistance i have this anecdote at some length as it to show how these sudden acts of hostility which have been attributed to caprice and may often arise from deep and generous motives which our to indian character and customs prevents our properly another ground of violent against the indians is their to the this had its origin partly in policy and partly in superstition the tribes though sometimes nations were never so formidable in their numbers but that the loss of several warriors was sensibly felt this was particularly the case when they had been frequently engaged in warfare and many an instance occurs in indian history where a tribe that had long been formidable to its neighbours has been broken up and driven away by the capture and of its principal fighting men there was a strong temptation therefore to the victor to be merciless not so much to gratify any cruel revenge l traits of indian li i to id â for future security the indians had the superstitious among nations and also among the that the of their friends who had fallen in battle were soothed by the blood of the the prisoners however who are not thus sacrificed are adopted into their families in place of the slain and are treated the confidence and affection of relatives nd friends nay so hospitable and tender is their that when the alternative is offered them they will often prefer to remain with their adopted brethren rather than return to the home and the friends of their youth the cruelty of the indians towards their prisoners has been heightened since the of the what was a with and superstition has exasperated into a gratification of vengeance th y cannot be sensible that the white men are the of their ancient dominion the cause of their degradation and the gradual of their race they go forth to battle with injuries and which they have suffered and they are driven to madness and despair by the wide spreading desolation and the overwhelming ruin of european the have too frequently set them an example of violence by burning their villages and laying waste their slender means of sub traits of indian i l and yet they wonder that savages do not show moderation and those have left them nothing but mere and wretchedness we the indians as cowardly a because they use in warfare in preference to open force but in this they are fully justified by their rude code of honour they â ire early taught that is warrior thinks it disgrace to in silence and take every advantage of his foe he triumphs in the superior craft and sagacity by which he has been enabled to surprise and destroy an n my indeed man is naturally more prone to than open owing to his physical weakness in comparison with other animals they are endowed with

has a long gentle and turns sod five to eight inches deep and eleven thirteen inches wide with such a long easy twist that notwithstanding the nature of the soil the is completely over burying the grass or weeds and and still leaving the surface in a measure compact and in much better condition than it would he if with ko which is made expressly for the purpose of up stiff and leaving them in a light mellow a no was made to require to be laid o er m flat with the edges closely matched and the natural of the parts preserved thus pr rather than of moisture this to prevent the of our excessive and et the depth of the of such a the earth is in fine condition for growing plants in direct contact with the e are the to they are made with high standards â that is high beams and and wide in the heel by which he is broken up in such a manner that the course of the is though five to ten inches deep and ten to thirteen inches wide some of this class of were got up expressly for the use of com by which they can bury and beneath the surface another which promises ti be very useful is called the double or sod and combined known in some parts of the country as the its consists in this upon tbe beam about where the or is usually there is a cast which cuts and turns the sod required depth while the main takes up the earth from the of tbe four or five inches deeper and lays it in a completely state on the top of the sod this a good of attention and generally remarks another has given a prominent position to one of the same sort which the original thinks is a upon his or at any rate so nearly like it that without the original the other would never have been conceived the is so little known to a majority of those who till american soil that a more particular description and slight history of its introduction will be found interesting in the year messrs co imported from scotland the first ever seen in the united states it was a complicated expensive affair as most of the scotch are and could not be after with any hope of successful introduction among farmers feeling satisfied of the benefits that would result to them from the use of a good that good genius of american farmers set his mind to work and produced one more simple lighter and cheaper than the imported article it was tried satisfactory and the manufacture of various sizes suited to a team of to six horses soon introduced this new t to the notice of many farmers who never had seen or heard ot the thing before but soon learned to profit by its s has no board the use of it is to enter the bottom ot tlie ordinary and stir up and the four to twenty four inches deep upon this the next round of the turning lays its usual thickness of thus the depth of it is especially valuable in land which has a natural hard pan or in which one has been formed by the of the team or the sliding of that instrument for a hundred years on the bottom of always just the same depth some idea can be formed of the shape of this by supposing the land side of the common cast iron one continued in a smooth plate up to b tee or eat exhibition the beam the being il e those of a on the board side of this plate there is a shelf projecting a couple of inches running in a gently inclined plane from head like point to the heel producing exactly the effect that a would do if drawn through the earth lifting it up and dropping it over the butt which is two to four inches high such is the in use in most of the northern states and its strength ease of draught and from five to fifteen dollars it was thought that perfection had been obtained in that farm not so for this very reason these great makers have brought out a new as much more simple than their first one as that is more simple than its scotch and yet more effective and not requiring more than one half the force to it besides which it is a a perfect idea of the shape of this cm he got in the way it was first obtained by professor to whom are the indebted for the original by taking a piece of paper twice as long as wide and folding it first end to end then side to side then cut off the corners from side t i now make a slight lap at the side folds and lay it down upon the table the edges will touch all round while the middle is slightly elevated now fancy a smooth piece of hardened of this shape twenty inches and seven and a quarter wide with an upright part eighteen inches high made broad and thin with edges alike so that it makes no difference which goes forward to a beam five feet long with handles four feet long bolted upon the of the beam held in place by an iron with a centre rod and dial four or five inches up or down or upon either side and th whole only eighty four pounds and yet strong enough for two yoke of oxen but not of too heavy a for one yoke when run up to the team in the ground producing such an effect as to shake bushes or plants several feet each side and you will have some idea of a new now publicly exhibited for the first time by the side of this last ,8
bring evidence from distant places of second or new trials in cases where the jury is hung or the verdict is set aside and of of the verdict and conduct of the by competent during the progress of all these and expensive proceedings what security is there as to the and of the fugitive upon their termination and if finally the should be successful contrary to what happens in ordinary between free persons he would have to bear all the burdens and expenses of the without and would learn by sad experience that he had by far better abandon his right in the first instance than to establish it at such cost and heavy sacrifice but whilst the committee conceive that a trial by jury in a state where a fugitive from service or labor is would do a denial of justice to the of such fugitive and would be to a positive refusal to execute the provision of the constitution the same objections do not apply to such a trial in the state from which he fled in the states full justice is administered with entire and in cases of all actions for freedom the person claiming his freedom is allowed to sue in counsel is assigned him time is allowed him to collect his witnesses and to attend the of the court and his is placed under bond and security or is of the possession during the progress of the trial to the enjoyment of these privileges and if there be any leaning on the part or courts and it is always to the side of the for freedom in deference to the feelings and prejudices which prevail in non states the committee propose such a trial in me state from which the fugitive fled in all cases where he declares to the officer giving the for his return that be has a right to his freedom accordingly the committee have prepared and report marked c two sections which they recommend should be in the fugitive bill in the according to these sections the is placed under bond and required to return the fugitive to that county in the state from which he fled and there to take him before a competent and allow him to assert and establish his freedom if be can affording to him for that purpose all the committee indulge the hope that if the fugitive bill with the proposed shall be passed by it will be effectual to secure the recovery of all from service or labor and it will remove all causes of complaint which have hitherto been experienced on that subject but if in practical operation it shall be found insufficient and if no adequate remedy can be devised for the restoration to their owners of fugitive slaves those owners shall have a just title to out of the treasury of the united states it remains to report upon the resolutions in relation to slavery and the slave trade in the district of without discussing the e of to slavery within the in regard to which a of opinion exists the committee are of opinion that it ought not to be it could not be done without indispensable conditions which are not likely to be agreed to it not be done with out exciting great apprehension and alarm in the slave states if the power were exercised with in this district the would apprehend that under some pretext or another it might hereafter be attempted to be exercised within the states it is true that at present all such power within those states is almost and in the free states but experience in public affairs has too often shown that where there is a desire to do a particular thing the power to accomplish it sooner or later will be found or assumed nor does the number of slaves within the district make the of slavery an object of any such consequence as appears to be attached to it in some of the union since the of county to virginia on the south side of the the district now consists only of washington county on the north side of that river and the returns of the of the people of the united states show a rapidly in the number of slaves in washington county according to the of the number and in it was reduced to showing a in ten years of nearly one third if it should continue in the same the number according to the now about to be taken will be only a little upward of two thousand but a majority of the committee think differently in regard to the slave trade within the district by that trade is meant the introduction of slaves from adjacent states into the district for sale or to be placed in for the purpose of subsequent sale or to other and distant that trade a majority of the committee are of opinion ought to be complaints have always existed against it no less on the part of members of from the south than on the part of members from the north it is a trade sometimes exhibiting spectacles and one in which the people of the district have no interest but on the contrary are believed to be desirous that it should be most if not all of the states have in their or by a trade in slaves as within their respective standing in regard to this district on this subject in a relation similar to that of the state to the people of the states may safely follow the example of the states the committee have and report a bill for the of that trade marked d the passage of which they recommend to the this bill has been framed after

the company through him i learned that there was no other key so effective in that country as a golden one instead of asking the authorities for permission to visit the prisoner i quietly took a guide and the men in charge of the prison to let me in was as comfortable in his situation as could be expected he had been able to mis giddy buy good food and plenty of h for the rest he didn t seem to care he was the most man i ever saw all he could think of was the dreadful death of young strange which had affected him and in the talk that he made i got my first information of the fact that the fellow had his head against a bridge and that had nothing at all to do with his taking off i asked him if he was doing anything toward a and he said he was not he didn t exactly want to die but he wasn t doing a thing tc save himself although he hadn t laid his hand on strange he felt that the young man had died from his fault that he would have been alive now if it hadn t been for him he said to me over and over that he had tried his best to kill him firing every shot in his revolver with that intent when i hinted that he might feel somewhat justified he would not listen he had been mad if his wife had loved another man better that her husband it did not give him the right to commit murder and it was s brother too that troubled him a great deal he had not seen the girl since his arrest refusing to allow her to enter his cell he did not believe he could face her he was glad i had called and hoped i would come again i told him the way i had and urged him not to mention my vl it then saying he would hear from me often i went away my next step was to engage a lawyer this lawyer soon discovered that both of the and the french maid t were ready to swear that strange with his own hands what b told indeed their were already on file to this effect it was a hard place to be in i tell you every person but who had seen the affair were against our friend the railroad agent and the spanish lawyer finally agreed on one thing the court would certainly the prisoner whenever he was brought to trial we must help him to escape in some way dr l not help interrupting do you say that i mean mrs stuck to the same story herself like a i talked to her about it repeatedly and she never varied her recital by the width of a hair she told me she was on the with her servants when her husband and that woman of his passed them had no warning jumped up and began firing at him a lot of pot shots when none of them took effect on the surprised young fellow the man sprang into her boat she said and dealt a terrible blow with a piece of wood there was no reason that she could for his conduct was the most boy that ever lived why i had seen him enough myself to know that the only thing she could think of as a cause for the assault was the fact that was with and he might have feared that the brother would against such an open scandal as their relations were making i put a hundred questions to her and she never turned an i reminded her that a conviction of her husband would be a stain on her name and on that of her child but to no effect she said the horror of the murder had made such an impression or jam her mind that she had lost every other consideration in the feeling that his crime ought to be punished if she was taken before a she would speak and tell the truth i told her after i had been to the prison what said pretending i had heard it from an and she answered that the and were her witnesses it was a nice mess to get out of wasn t it dr replied with a shrug of the shoulders that it was indeed and how did you get out of it he added with great interest u where there s a will there s a way as you may have heard some one remark i merely let the case be tried and the verdict be recorded i don t mean that we didn t cross question those confounded and where are done in writing this takes time but would not let us call the only other witness besides himself to the real reason of strange s death he said the lawyers would be almost certain to something about her character which was as pure as the snow that is driven he wouldn t risk that he told his own story and it was met with the oaths of three persons that he was a liar a verdict was recorded of his guilt and he was to be shot the listener as he heard the words it was as if a ball had just whistled over his shoulder close to his ear of course i had seen the girl pursued the quietly if i had not convinced her that we would yet save s life she would have moved heaven and earth and perhaps though it may be doubted the government at washington to what told fast t get him free the lawyer and i persuaded her that we could do more if she did not interfere she was a sad sight those days though talk about attach ment she would have given ,5

the divorce of i earning from manual labor â the absolute dependence of the educated on the class for the means of sup its physical wants â becomes the source of endless and fatal of principle and of intellectual power it nothing to point me to the failure if it shall be so termed of past attempts to study with physical exertion â the mind with the ready and skilful hand these failures only prove the of the effort not that the object is unworthy nor even they have been impelled too often by low ideas of their own scope and purpose â by a consideration of the necessity to the student not so much of labor as of bread commenced in this spirit the number of workers will inevitably till only those labor who must on the fruits of that labor soon the class distinction of gentlemen and and and and one class or the other â probably both make their exit the institution and the superficial multitude pronounce the idea of labor with study proved and absurd the fatal error here was obviously that of putting the new wine into old bottles the impulse to the enterprise was not a conviction of the necessity and dignity of labor â not even the idea of duty as commanding a in the toil needful to the and comfort of man â but at bottom the s necessity the slave s dread of the lash this may and the production of corn â never of true men not until labor shall be joyfully and proudly accepted as a genial and beneficent destiny â as the needful exercise and of our else or faculties â may we hope for any satisfactory result and here you will permit me to hazard a criticism on so much of our processes â no great portion of any college course i hope â as are undertaken for the sake it is said of the mind i ask a why he who is to the christian should devote so much time to a science so little to his future calling as and he answers that the study of is an admirable discipline for the mind need i say to you that i neither appreciate the force of the reason nor discern the benefits of the discipline i do not say that this or any other science may not be eminently calculated to the purpose contemplated â i simply to the necessity or fitness of pursuing mental discipline apart from mental activity in the sphere of practical life does the youth contemplate the pursuit of or any sphere of usefulness requiring the aid of the exact â then let him devote his student years in part to and master them thoroughly but if he contemplate pursuing either of the three leading professions law or â i distrust the wisdom of such a devotion of his time this life is too short to justify the acquisition of on such grounds the mind is best when it finds its pleasures in its duties â when all its laborious are turned to direct and palpable account â when its every impulse is toward utility and we give tl e child because we know not or have not what we should give him â did we know all things command all things we should improve his every desire to directly some useful end his toys would be tools or at least of some truth adapted to his opening mind he should be wiser for every walk â more for each hour s diversion in our ignorance or fond we waste half the golden opportunities of the most period of ufe and a portion of the remainder it were well to remember that a has the mental we contemplate and that it needs not to be pressed and fashioned bnt simply developed the ine it requires if is into whatever is peculiar to that sphere of endeavor to which it is specially devoted and here let me state fairly the objection of the school to the acquisition of the dead languages which i find often commented on and without being at all apprehended we do not we never did deny the utility of these languages to many â it would ill become us to do so â ill become any rational beings we admit â nay insist that there are large to which a thorough knowledge of one or more of the languages in which the noblest most inspiring ideas of antiquity lie is indispensable the christian needs a mastery of greek and hebrew the physician the the thorough lawyer of latin but beyond and above these the world needs and is deeply indebted to the illustrious body of scholars learned men who as professors o most term philosophers poets critics are constantly and the present by the light of the past noblest least of our teachers â we could not dispense with these â â we are in no danger of them too highly but it is not given to every man â it is permitted to few â to be of these and it is preposterous to subject the multitude of comparatively educated persons to their ordeal in the idle hope of producing any such result you cannot make scholars of these â you have enough to do to render them and doctors in the common way and if they are to be such and nothing more you must allow me to believe that their college years might be better devoted than to the acquisition of greek and latin â oftener practically forgotten in two years than really learned in three the simple and notorious fact that they usually are so forgotten â that they are to most educated men so called in the busy walks of life but a of dull days wasted and dry tasks is their sufficient

the shades wanted the leaves and of the flowers are tinted by the hand with a s hair brush they require great of execution the beauty of the flower consisting in the degree of artistic softness with which the different shades are blended into each other in the cutting room we find a number of boys engaged in cutting out with metal forms having sharpened edges following the outlines of the object the leaves and other parts of the flower which are susceptible of being thus treated the material is laid on a lead block to prevent the edge of the form fi om being and a blow of a hammer being given to the latter eight folds of the material are cut at a stroke into so many leaves if velvet be employed its thickness will not admit of its being folded more than twice the leaves being cut to the required form the next process is to impart to them by pressure the different veins and which exist in the original for this purpose dies or are used in with their the leaf being inserted between them and submitted to the action of a hand s the exhibition press nothing can be more perfect oi natural than the resemblance thus obtained the leaves are now shaded with a s pencil and sent into another department to have stems attached to them the wire used for this purpose is covered either with silk or cotton and is imported ready prepared it is on to the leaf and if the latter be made of it is then dipped into wax to impart to it a smooth some of the leaves however those intended the finer descriptions of flowers require to be painted before they are none but a very expert workman can be

means of we will now enter the flower room where the materials thus prepared are sent to be completed here we find between forty and fifty women and children employed in passing them through their different stages here also may be seen another illustration of the advantages arising from the division of labor the materials being no sooner received from the cutting room than they are worked up in an uncommonly short space of time not only into single flowers but into elaborate ready the let us take for instance a rose and follow it from hand to hand until it arrives at maturity one girl makes the heart of the flower either with thread or raw silk and dipping it in colored passes it on to the the are by another and sent to the same destination the are to a third generally an experienced hand and the separate parts of the flower being now completed the groups and them together this latter is the most important person perhaps in the whole establishment great taste and practice being

qualities necessary to the successful discharge their duties having shown that this of industry is rapidly and that we are likely soon to the of foreign goods by the perfection of our own it will be naturally expected that the results exhibited at the crystal palace will a fair index of its present prosperous state owing to some unaccountable feeling of however on the part of the makers or to some other cause which it is difficult to penetrate we regret to say that this is not the case with the exception of one house that of messrs we do not see any of our leading makers who figure on the list of these gentlemen exhibit a ease of artificial flowers consisting of and composed of flowers and leaves every part of which they state was and mounted in their factory in new york they are must beautifully executed and appear to us to combine and freshness with a of tint and fidelity to the which render them worthy to be with some of the best french flowers they also show a case of leaves an immense variety of the different species of foliage and which are by the same careful attention to details they were all made in their factory and afford a valuable evidence of what enterprise and

condition and dignity hopeless is the degradation of the slave who the chains and which hold him in perpetual bondage so on a kindred though apparently opposite point to me it seems indispensable to the just steady and sure elevation of labor that the industry of each community or people be rendered as various and as is consistent with in production â that everywhere arts c should and with each other so as to afford employment for the greatest possible of tastes and in regard to pursuits you may agree with me that it is the proper duty of government to strive for and as far as possible secure such by and the introduction of such of useful labor as are yet or in their infancy â or you may incline to the opposite theory that this matter will better take care of itself and that government can not act more wisely than to let it entirely alone i will not here discuss the relative of these theories but i insist that the condition of the laboring class can never be independent and comfortable while a nation its bread or its clothing its wares or its mainly from abroad i know well that national are in the eye of as if they were not i look only to the inevitable consequences of carrying grain across half a continent and an ocean and bringing back in return and i say that this is in general at deadly war with the permanent interests of labor which demand hints toward that the of should be hi the main as direct and simple as possible and as nearly as may be between and produced with but one or two at most so long as the grain grown in the great valley of the is in good part exchanged for the of england the of ireland the and of france the glass the toys the of germany â all which if needed might as well be produced in our own country as elsewhere â so long will the bulk of american labor be deprived of more than half its just reward through the depression of its great at the point of production and the of a superfluous traffic at this moment corn abundantly for twenty cents per in the most productive sections of our great west though ireland eagerly pays for it two dollars per and so with other things the charges twice to thrice as much for conveying each from new york to liverpool as the farmer receives for growing it the ultimate remedy for this â effect it as you will â is the of the arts and if need be the of the old world along side of the fertile of our boundless west thereby securing them twice as much grain for the product of each day s labor as they now receive while in equal measure our farmers and the non productive labor now employed in needless into the channels of productive industry call this if you please a â to me it seems if are to be prevented i proceed with my general statement unquestionably the of labor is to bo effected through or in with the mental and moral improvement of the laboring class so far all are of one mind but whoever thence that nothing is to be done nor even attempted in the way of physical or of labor until the laboring class shall have wrought out its own thorough spiritual development and moral might as well declare himself a champion of the slave trade at once the internal and external are each necessary to the completeness of the other merely his tasks and his comforts will not raise a ignorant to tlie dignity of true manhood but no more can just and luminous ideas of his own nature relations duties and destiny be expected often to the mind of one doomed to a life of abject and tom said a colonel on the to one of his command how can so brave and good a soldier as you are so himself as to get drunk at every opportunity â colonel replied the private how can you expect all the virtues that adorn the human character for seven dollars a month the answer however in morals a grave truth self respect is the shield of virtue comfort and hope are the we the world for our good behavior in it take these away and temptation is left without force or influence without hope and without god in the world says an inspired let not the or its significance be forgotten show me a community a class a calling wherein poverty discomfort and excessive toil have come to be regarded as an inexorable destiny and i will tell you that there the laws of god and man are sullenly defied or disregarded the education of the poor is a matter of the very highest and most pressing social concern here are hundreds on every side of us toiling their lives out for some four to six shillings per day and barely existing in want and wretchedness when others no wiser and better than they earn thrice as much and live in ease and comfort this immense has its origin in hints toward the slight and circumstance that the one class were in youth so fortunate or so as ta be enabled to acquire trades or in which labor is well rewarded while the others have grown up at random doing what came or rather that which in the general scramble was left to them and now they are qualified only for

be controlled by an authority which is merely called into existence for the purpose of making rules and for the disposition and management of property such it appears to me would be the construction put upon this provision of the constitution were this question now first presented for consideration and not controlled by imperious circumstances the original of tke of the passed in j and which was the only act upon this subject in force at the of the constitution provided a complete frame of government for the country north of the while in a condition and for its admission in separate states into the union and the persuasion that this contained within itself all the necessary means of execution probably prevented any direct reference to the subject in the constitution further than in the right to admit the states formed under it into the union however circumstances arose which required as well over the territory north of the as over other territory both within and without the original union to the general government ana at various times a more enlarged power has been exercised over the â meaning thereby tho different â than is conveyed by the limited grant referred to how far an existing necessity may have in producing this and thus extending by rather a violent powers not directly given i know not but certain it is that the principle of interference should not be carried beyond the necessary which produces it it should be limited o the creation of proper for new countries acquired or set tied and to the necessary provision for their admission into the union leaving in the mean time to the people them to their internal concerns in their own way they are as capable of doing so as the people of the states and they can do so at any rate an soon as their political independence is recognized by admission into the union during this temporary condition it is hardly expedient to call into exercise a doubtful and authority which questions the intelligence of a respectable portion of our citizens and whose whatever it may be will be rapidly approaching its termination â an authority which would give to power by the constitution over most important sections of our common country for if the relation of master and servant may be regulated or by its so may the of husband ana wife of parent and child and of any other condition which our institutions and the habits of our society recognize what would be thought if should undertake to the terms of marriage in new york or to the authority of parents over their children in and yet it would be as vain to seek one the interference of the national in the cases referred to in the original states of the union i speak here of the inherent power of and do not touch the question of such as may be formed with new states when admitted into the of all the questions that v can us those which are merely in their character are the most dangerous and the most to be the warning voice of him who from his character and services and virtue had the best right to warn us proclaimed to his countrymen in his farewell address â that monument of wisdom for him as i hope it will be of safety for them â how much we to apprehend from measures peculiarly affecting sections of our country the grave circumstances in which we are now placed make these words words of safety for i am satisfied from all i have seen and heard here that a successful attempt to the principles of the upon the of this government and to apply them to new territory should new territory be acquired would seriously affect our tranquillity i do not suffer myself to foresee or to the consequences that would for i trust and believe there is good sense and good feeling enough in the country to avoid them by avoiding all occasions which might lead to them briefly then i am opposed to the exercise of any by over this matter and i am in favor of leaving to the people of any territory which may be hereafter acquired the right to it for themselves under the general principles of the constitution because â i do not see in the constitution any grant of the requisite power to and i am not disposed to extend a doubtful precedent beyond its necessity â the establishment of when leaving to the inhabitants all the rights with the relations they bear to the because i believe this measure if adopted would if not the union of the states and would sow the seeds of future discord which would grow up and into an abundant harvest of calamity because i believe a general conviction that such a proposition would succeed would lead to an immediate of the supplies and the thus to a termination of the war i think no observer at the seat of government can doubt this result if however in this i am under a i am under none in the practical operation of this if adopted by upon a treaty of peace making any acquisition of territory such a treaty would be rejected as certainly as presented to the more than one third of that body would vote it such a principle as an of the citizens of the slave holding states from a in the benefits acquired by the treasure and exertions of all and which should be common to all i am repeating â neither advancing nor defending these views that branch of the subject does not lie in my way and i shall not turn aside to seek it in this aspect of the matter the people o the united states must choose between this and the extension of their limits they cannot have both and which they will surrender must depend ,8

light are enabled to struggle down to the inhabitants whose broad day is at best but a tolerable twilight the room was into boxes each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth ready for dinner this showed that the guests were of the good old stamp and divided their day equally for it was but just one o clock at the lower end of the room was a clear coal fire before which a breast of lamb was a row of bright brass and along the mantle piece and an old fashioned clock in one corner o the s head there was something primitive in this of kitchen parlour and hall that carried me to earlier times and pleased me the place indeed was humble but every thing had that look of order and neatness which the of a notable english a group of looking beings who might be either or sailors were themselves in one of the boxes as i was a visitor of rather higher pretensions i was ushered into a little miss n back room having at least nine corners it was lights by a sky light furnished with chairs and ornamented with the portrait of a fa it was evidently appropriated to particular customers and i found a shabby gentleman in a red nose and oil cloth hat seated in one corner meditating on a half empty pot of porter the old had taken the landlady aside and with an air of profound importance imparted to her my errand dame was a likely plump bustling little woman and no bad substitute for that of dame quickly she seemed delighted with an opportunity to oblige and hurrying up stairs to the of her house where the precious vessels of the parish club were deposited she returned smiling and with them in her hands the first she presented me was a iron tavern q tobacco box of gigantic size out of which i the had smoked at their stated meetings since time and which was never suffered to be by vulgar hands or used oil occasions i received it with becoming reverence but what was my delight at beholding on its cover the identical painting of which j was in quest there was displayed the outside of the s head tavern and before the door was to be seen the whole group at table hi full pictured with that fidelity and force with which the portraits of renowned and are illustrated on boxes for the benefit of posterity lest how ever there should be any mistake the cunning had inscribed the names of prince and on the of their the inside of the cover was an inscription nearly that this box was the gift of sir richard for the use of the meetings at the s head tavern and that it was repaired and by his successor mr john such is a faithful description of this august and venerable and i question whether the learned contemplated his roman shield or the knights of the round table the long sought san with more exultation while i was meditating on it with o tut s head

the gift of francis knight and was held she told me in exceeding great value being considered very this last opinion was strengthened by the shabby gentleman in the red nose and hat and whom i strongly suspect to be a from the he suddenly aroused from his meditation on the pot of porter and casting a knowing look at the exclaimed aye aye the head don t ache now that made that there article the great importance attached to this of ancient by modern at first puzzled me but there is nothing the apprehension so much as for i immediately perceived that this could be no other than the

come after the last possible effort to escape should have been made there would in that case be left to us the of fidelity to duty but i reply further that i few i think know better than iâ the resources and energies of the party which is identical with the slave power i do ample to its popularity i know few i think know better than iâ the and of a new political force like the republican

party derived its strength originally from its of the principles of equal and exact justice to all men so long as it this principle faithfully it was it became when it the principle and since that time it has itself not by virtue of its own strength or even of its merits but because there as yet had appeared in the political field no other party that had the and the courage to take up and and practice the life principles which the party had surrendered at last the party has appeared it now as the republican party of did in one word its faith and its works equal and exact justice to all men even when it first entered the field only half organized it struck a blow which only just failed to secure complete and triumphant victory in this its second campaign it has ah won advantages which render that triumph now both easy and certain the secret of its assured success lies in that very characteristic which in the mouth of its great and lasting and reproach it lies in the fact that it is a party of one idea but that idea is a noble an idea that fills and all generous souls the idea of the equality of all men before human and human laws as they all are equal before the divine and divine laws i know and you know that a revolution has begun i know and all the world knows that never go backward twenty and a hundred representatives proclaim boldly in to day sentiments and opinions and principles of freedom which hardly so many men even in this free state dared to utter in the r own homes twenty ears ago while the government of the united states under the conduct of the party has been all that time cue plain and castle after another to slavery the people of the united states have been no less steadily and gathering the forces with which to re cover back again all the

feature and admitted you to the ample hall which ran entirely through the house to the back door and a long back beyond it a sufficiently wide to suggest in the rooms above led on one side of the hall to the upper floor the front door was not only equipped with a of the black stock bell which when i pulled the handle for a minute or more somewhere outside behind the house but it was with a large and handsome old brass of a classical design everything was solid and had once been handsome but struck me now as sadly out of repair indeed an air of neglect and loneliness seemed to the whole place when i entered which i did not do until i had both rung and knocked several times and a negro woman had come around the side of the house and after looking at me had asked whom i wanted to see i found things much the same way within that they were without the hall was hung with paintings some of which seemed to me fine but they were dim and and the frames were all dingy and old the room i was shown into was furnished the old gentleman with old furniture and filled with handsome things but everything appeared to me to be placed without the least regard to either fitness or comfort the chairs were all ranged back stiffly against the wall and and other a were scattered around in a hopeless fashion that was distressing the library into which i was at length shown was the only exception to this condition it was evidently a living room and the fine old books everything yet even there were signs of the neglect which spoke from every spot books piled on tables and chairs and even on the floor in a confusion which nobody but one long familiar to it could have understood my host however who met me most graciously when i was at length admitted to the house seemed to divine where things of the black stock were in that room at least and made my visit so agreeable that instead of spending one half hour with him i spent several he possessed a knowledge of books which appeared to me rare and possessed what was more that delightful art of books of which he talked with a certain personality which made them seem like living beings he did not quote books so much as he made them quote themselves they were not books but the men who wrote them he brought their authors in and made them talk with you he appeared particularly fond of the poets and the though he declared there were very few of either who were sincere when you find a sincere man in a book sir he said he is like a sincere man in life you know him at once and he is the old ones ere sincere shake the old gentleman of course i remember he said because he knew the human soul and could not help it it was as if he had stood face to face with god and dared not tell anything but truth milton was sincere because he was a bacon because he was too wise not to be of the he said old johnson was almost the only who was sincere and that was his value you could always count on him a clear and vigorous man who saw straight and told it as he saw it the others were nearly all writing either for popularity or for some other miserable end why sir he said i have piles of them there i will not even put on my shelves i will not admit them to the companionship of gentlemen the poets at least try to do something some of them do was sincere because he was a of the black stock poet and was they had a high idea of their profession â as a lawyer for instance he may not have a large or practice and yet may be an ornament to the bar because of the high plane on which he i asked him about and he admitted the sincerity of both but he did not like because he was ill tempered and sour and was always at others without his inspiration or his occasion he said of him he is not a gentleman sir and has never forgiven either the world or himself for it he put on a much higher plane but though he admitted his sincerity and him the first american literary man he said he did not read him he too much for me he said and he is all when i want preaching i go to church so the old gentleman he liked his poetry better than his prose though he declared it was hardly verse after all he said the best of these to me is the first â and next to him the second â is as modern as if he had just written because he knew human nature it is always the same drew from him and the others from they have all been him ever since he wrote he was a man who knew himself as he was and had the sense and the courage to be truthful was not so great as because he was less spiritual but he knew the human heart why sir he added with unwonted enthusiasm i am enough like to be his embodied spirit when i read i feel as if i were reading myself it is a pleasure to me to know that they are the two which we know of the black stock absolutely shakespeare read you cannot get a man nowadays to tell you what he really feels or thinks feeling has gone out of fashion every one is to repress his feeling and he does not think at all why sir we are all ,1

six feet above the floor at the further end of the hall was already occupied with a of â nearly a dozen perhaps â some of whom had flung their feet upon the rail before them and were back upon their seats ready to proceed to their our friend occupied his place with a countenance of becoming importance indeed the whole bench presented a fine picture of solid faces and figures that might be said to be a healthy and sturdy specimen of this pillar of the of the state â and was well calculated to inspire a wholesome respect for that inferior and useful which has always been so much a favorite of the people of virginia immediately under the gallery of the sat the clerk of the court and on either side of his desk within the area of the were benches designed for the this array of the court and jury was a long narrow platform guarded all round with railing and elevated a few feet above the floor within whose were disposed some five or six members of the bar most perched upon seats of a height out of all proportion to the human figure and before these a narrow desk extended the whole distance so as to give to the place of their accommodation somewhat of the dimensions of a these courts hold their monthly and their reaches almost all the ordinary legal of the county but as the limit over which they is generally small it requires but a few days to the business of each term the first matter that occupied the attention of the court was the of the grand jury to whom the usual charge was delivered this office was assigned by the court to one of th members of the bar a young did not fail to em the county court l i the summary of duties which he unfolded to their view ith a plentiful of notwithstanding the exaggeration of the solemnity of the occasion and the grave topics which were urged upon the grand it seems that this of the dignity was sadly puzzled to find employment in any degree with the of its function it is said that the in their minds the whole list of national one party suggested the idea of presenting the established mode of the president of the united states as a grievance to the good people of the county another thought of a formal of the a few an assault upon the su court but all were happily brought into a harmonious in the design of presenting a mad cap by the name of smith for disturbing the peace of a by drinking and breeding a riot within the of the accordingly after an hour s deliberation upon these various suggestions they returned to the with a solitary bill made out in due form against and this matter the sum total of their business for the term they were thereupon discharged with the thanks of the court for the able and administration of their duties smith had anticipated this act of authority and was now in court ready to stand his trial he had already selected his counsel â a and energetic advocate whose strength lay according to the popular opinion in his skill in managing a jury the name of this of s fame was pro or as it was called for toll hedges esq a gentleman whose were too short for him and whose bare legs were consequently visible above his stockings toll s figure however was adorned with a new blue coat of the county court the most conceited fashion which nevertheless gave some indications of having been recently slept in as it was supplied with down from i feather bed he was conspicuous also for an old straw hat that had been fretted at the rim by a careless habit in handling it this learned counsel had keeping his too strictly the night before for his eyes were red and his face his frame had all the morning languor of a night and altogether toll did not appear to be in the best condition to try his case however he had now taken his seat at the bar and close beside him sat his smith an blade who had the to come into court without coat or waistcoat and to show a wild grinning countenance to his whilst the gentleman who conducted the case for the was giving a narrative of s to the jury and was that worthy s character in good set terms toll was to all appearance asleep upon his folded arms resting on the desk before him when the charge was fairly explained one witness was called to support it this individual was pretty much such a looking person as himself he was rather down faced and confused in his before the court and particularly shabby in his exterior but he told a plain straight forward story enough in the main and his evidence went the full length of all the s the truth was had certainly broke into the camp and played some strange considering the of the place but during all this time hedges esq maintained his position except now and then when feeling himself pinched by the testimony his head to whisper in his counsel s ear which act roused him enough to bring upon a rebuke that was generally conveyed by pushing him off and the county court to be quiet at length the whole story was told and bad enough it looked for the attorney for the now informed mr

such an between the and of the craft and the of a stern integrity that he can only succeed in the practice by kicking conscience overboard and giving the command to respectable â what alternative has the man educated to live only by his â hints toward sion but to take the broad road and keep it at whatever internal sacrifice a prime minister once to the who said to him i must live you know replied pardon me sir i do not perceive the necessity but rarely has any one so decided in his own case even if living be to him personally a matter of indifference there are those dependent on his exertions whom he can not so resign to the of adverse fortune hence a life of mean and self condemned becomes a sort of necessity to thousands â nay often the seeming dictate of paternal or duty thus the which should separate vice from virtue are broken down and the ends of life are lost sight of in a desperate degrading struggle for the means of living c the most effectual remedy for this which is under our present social order is the of manual labor with education so that they should be inseparable by the wealth or personal distinction of the let it be settled as a base of our higher popular education that a stated portion of each day shall be devoted to the acquisition of skill in some department of industry â to manual labor for the sake of the strength it the it the comforts it the independence it and the professional man may then stand up before his flock his his in an attitude of conscious self reliance and say to them employ and me if you choose the earth and the kindly elements will reward my efforts if you do not want them and so long as vegetation proceeds and sunshine follows the shower i can exist as well without you as you can without me i have learned to labor with my hands and i am neither afraid nor ashamed to do so and whenever i have no other employment i shall joyfully earn my bread thus surely the opinions and of the professional man in this attitude would deserve and command a degree of respect teachers and teaching which is not now accorded to them he could never more be rendered the slave of others vices or prejudices he would be master of his own aims if not of his destiny the humiliating consciousness that any reckless following of conscience out of the track of or tradition would almost entirely deprive him of bread would vanish for ever in its stead would come self respect and serenity and not â e respect only but the respect of those made to realize that his did not depend on his to the standard of their opinions or desires my profound conviction that the independence adequate in and proper dignity of the better educated or professional class demands a reform in our systems of instruction which shall render the educated man as well as knowing handy as well as long headed will not allow me to neglect any fair opportunity of and on the of manual labor as an part of our better e not for their own though greatly for those do i insist that the thinking class shall become a working class in the rude palpable sense i demand a more relation between the man who lives by turning and him who to turn hearts that spectacle of the emperor of china standing forth under the sun a of the can you think that â â it has no worth no meaning but as a state â a of ages i tell you nay â it is to day and will be while time and it a most

does half so much toward the right governing of those millions as on that day when he turns the beneath the gaze of thousands does he prove himself truly a ruler and more â a teacher by example â of truths which if once universally accepted and lived would make governing easy and outward forcible government a quite subordinate matter for let men but profoundly realize the dignity and true meaning of labor â let them feel that not the fruits of it alone are but the work itself is desirable essential to the well being of every son and daughter of adam and it is not possible that standing armies

a town they glided before me as i walked sometimes in my solitude i laughed with the bitterness the of self scorn remembering how i had given up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine what had i ever had to do with them and why being now free should i take this on me once again it was both sad and dangerous i whispered to myself to be in too close with the passions the errors and the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their own into which if i at all it must be as an intruder and at a peril that i could not estimate drawing nearer to a sickness of the spirits kept with my flights of i indulged in a hundred odd and extravagant conjectures either there was no such place as nor ever had been nor any brotherhood of thoughtful like what i seemed to recollect there or else it was all changed during my absence it had been nothing but dream work and enchantment i should seek in vain for the old farm house and for the green the fields the root crops and acres of indian com and for all that of the land which i had imagined it would be another spot and an utter strangeness these were of the throng so apt to steal out of an heart they partly ceased to haunt me on my arriving at a point whence through the trees i began to catch glimpses of the farm that surely was something real there was hardly a square foot of all those acres on which i had not trodden heavily in one or another kind of toil the curse of adam s posterity â and curse or blessing be it it gives substance to the life around us â had first come the upon me there in the sweat of my brow i had there earned bread and eaten it and so established my claim to be on earth and my fellowship with all the sons of labor i could have knelt down and have laid my breast against that soil the red clay of which my frame was seemed nearer akin to those crumbling than to any other portion of the world s dust there was my home and there might be my grave i felt an invincible reluctance nevertheless at the idea of presenting myself before my old associates without first the state in which they were a nameless weighed upon me perhaps should i know all the circumstances that had occurred i might find it my wisest course to turn back unseen and never look at more had it been evening i would have stolen softly to some lighted window of the old farm house and peeped in to see all their well known faces round the supper board then were there a vacant seat i might noiselessly the door glide in and take my place among them without a word my entrance might be so quiet my aspect so familiar that they would forget how long i had been away and suffer me to melt into the scene as a wreath of into a larger cloud i dreaded a boisterous greeting beholding me at table as a matter of course would send me a cup of tea and fill my plate from the great dish of and in her quiet way would hand the cream and others help me to the bread and butter being one of them again the knowledge of what had happened would come to me without a shock for still at the romance every turn of my shifting the thought stared me in the face that some evil thing had befallen us or was ready to befall yielding to this ominous impression i now turned aside into the woods to spy out the posture of the community as as the wild indian before he makes his i would go wandering about the outskirts of the farm and perhaps catching sight cf a solitary acquaintance would approach him amid the brown shadows of the trees a kind of medium fit for spirits departed and like myself and entreat him to tell me how all things were the first living creature that i met was a which sprung up beneath my feet and away the next was a who angrily at me from an overhanging bough i trod along by the dark river and remember pausing on the bank above one of its and most placid pools â the very spot with the stump of a tree over the water is itself to my fancy at this instant â and wondering how deep it was and if any over laden soul had ever flung its weight of in thither and if it thus escaped the or only made it heavier and perhaps the skeleton of the drowned wretch still lay beneath the inscrutable depth clinging to some sunken log at the bottom with the of its old despair so slight however was the track of these gloomy ideas that i soon forgot them in the contemplation of a brood of wild ducks which were floating on the river and anon took flight leaving each a bright streak over the black surface by and by i came to my in the heart of the white pine tree and the up into it sat down to rest the grapes which i had watched throughout the summer now around me in abundant clusters of the deepest purple sweet to the taste and though wild yet free from that flavor which nearly all our native and grapes a wine might be pressed out of them possessing a passionate zest and endowed with a new kind of quality attended with such as the grapes of france and the are inadequate to produce and i longed to a great of it at that moment while devouring the grapes i looked ,2

and especially so i n various parts of the on the northern coast of the northern was found whereas the other species was in the greatest abundance both forms unite in the same flocks and were found throughout the sea as far as the penetrated during the summer of but in this part of the range the northern in spite of its name was less and less numerous the farther north we advanced while the other species was in equal number throughout both birds occur during the about the and other islands of sea but the northern appears to be the only species breeding in the chain and thence north to saint island where the red nests we learn from that the northern on and at the new islands besides being found all along the north coast v of steamer in the ocean the little from the of north along the of to sound this small northern representative of the well known sand hill is found breeding in abundance especially towards the northern portion of this range it also occurs on saint and saint islands though it occurs in small numbers at these points during his visit to saint s island on august saw a few of these birds and it has been found on the east coast in the vicinity of saint bay where saw a considerable number of them as he was passing south in july after in the until very recently this bird has been confounded with the larger sand hill and various authors who have referred to from the northern region of america according to our present knowledge referred to the present bird which this territory exclusively on the coast of sound it is extremely common and throughout the summer from early in may until toward the end of september its loud rolling note and tall figure over the are among the most sights and sounds of this region they are not very shy and i have frequently approached them within by merely appearing not to notice them but continuing in a circuit to walk round their position until within sixty or seventy five yards the bird continuing to stare at me and uttering its long note and appearing as if doubtful whether it was worth while to take wing or not until its thoughts were by a shot they are extremely curious at this season and i have frequently them within by lying upon the ground and waving a hand or some conspicuous article in the air as the birds approach from a distance they will almost invariably turn and try to investigate the matter before passing on their way in many cases they only make a slight from their course and pass on but i have frequently had six or eight of the birds about until some would approach within thirty five or forty yards offering an easy prize their food is composed of the various which grow so abundantly on the of the north with an addition of whatever other are found such as a stray or mouse or even insects and other small that chance may afford they are not very good eating although takes its turn in varying the of the fare in the north â ducks whistling swan during the of the this fine bird was observed but once this occasion was on july while we were at the head of sound where it was found with feathers as were the at that place although the swan was seen so rarely during this expedition yet the bird is to be found in large numbers along the coast of sea here it especially from the mouth south to the mouth of the river where the flat land dotted with innumerable lakes affords a favorite resort it was not seen on the coast and i have no record of its occurrence there but this or an allied species occurs there on the american shore but a single species of swan occurs the large swan not being known west of fort we learn from mr s paper on the birds of the islands that several specimens of this swan were shot upon island in september some years ago but they are unknown from the chain proper and from the other islands in sea of steamer in the ocean h pall snow on the american coast of the and sea this bird is not very abundant it occurs however in considerable flocks for a few days daring the spring and fall and each season a f w are killed in the vicinity of saint michael s on sound its occurrence upon the north coast of asia is by specimens captured by s party at in the spring of these birds are at present like the swan unknown from the islands of sea their apparently taking an inland course rather than along the shore lines although the snow are known to nest in the greatest abundance in the river and surrounding region along the northern coast of british america yet their place in is unknown they certainly do not remain to nest anywhere along the sea coast and we did not see any of these birds along the shore to point so that if they nest at all in this region it must be on those the shore east of point in autumn they leave for the south among the last of the finding their way to the vicinity of saint michael s towards the end of september although in some seasons they appear before the middle of this month they linger here in autumn from ten days to three weeks depending upon the weather to a great extent the great abundance of tliis bird in during the winter season would testify to its breeding in great numbers somewhere to the north of this region but according to my observations on the sea coast of the bird must take some other route towards its northern ,13
good with rather thin bark and scattering their seeds every year as soon as they are ripe they are quickly driven out of fire swept regions when the were melting these hardy trees were probably among the first to arrive on the new soil beds but as the became and fires began to run they were driven up the mountains and into the wet spots and islands where we now find them leaving nearly all the park to the pine which though as thin as they and as easily killed by fire takes pains to store the national park â â up its seeds in firmly closed and holds them from three to nine years so that let the fire come when it may it is ready to die and ready to again in a new generation for when the killing fires have devoured the leaves and thin bark many of the only open as soon as the smoke away the store of seeds is sown on the cleared ground and a new growth immediately springs up triumphant out of the ashes therefore this tree not only holds its ground but extends its farther after every fire thus the and of its growth are accounted for in one part of the forest that i examined the growth was about as close as a the trees were from four to eight inches in one hundred feet high and one hundred and seventy five years old the lower limbs die young and drop off for want of light life with these close planted trees is a race for light more and so they push straight for the sky off ten feet from the top of the forest would make it look like a crowded mass of telegraph poles for only the sunny tops are leafy a ten years old growing in the sunshine has as many leaves as a crowded tree one or two hundred years old as fires are multiplied and the become this wonderful pine bids fair to obtain possession of nearly all the forest ground in the west our national how still the woods seem

must know i pride myself on being very useful to the ladies â that is i take boxes for them at the theatre go with them supply them with and furnish them with novels from the library in consequence of these attentions i am a great favourite and there is seldom a party going on in the city without my having an invitation the grievance i have to mention is the ex i o whim and opinions dear going down

first principles of the christian religion and he more than ever that the estate of tower instead of to so unworthy a had not passed â as he understood that at one time there had been hopes of its passing â into the pure hands of one who loved the church lady had she been conscious of this would have said you mean the church s ministers but therein she would have wronged the priest narrow and harsh as his views made him he was no on the contrary he lived a life of and did more good work every twelve hours than some persons of more elastic faith are wont to compass in a the little dinner in street could not however be considered a success even mr acknowledged that he had put his foot in it and always afterward spoke of mr as his ghostly enemy richard on his side in addition to his dislike of the was very far from at ease he could not speak to his aunt of the matter which still lay next his heart and in which she had taken such a prominent part her gentle voice was more sweet and low than ever when she addressed him that evening and the clasp of her hand had a more tender significance for him than of old his meeting with her turned his thoughts back for the time into the old channel and made him sad did aunt speak to you he inquired of his friend as they drove home of â of â well yes returned that young gentleman she said something very civil â though quite unnecessary about my having gone to the tower when you were in trouble she didn t say whether she was still living at the old place then after a long silence richard asked whether his friend would mind calling in ford s alley â not i want to see her again you know but just to hear how she is shrugged his shoulders to express of this course but answered i will go of course and the next day he went accordingly on his return he found richard looking i pale and anxious well tell me whom he said who did you see i saw the most wonderful person an old lady wrinkled with a beard in the wi place â over her eyes â v less black than we re painted of the by any means she thought me no better than i should be evidently and indeed since i was not to mention name i did feel i had very little right to ask questions but you did ask after â after â i asked after and i was told she no longer lived there i then inquired e she did live and was informed â that it was no business of mine i was told indeed she was well but in the same tone in which we used to reply to kind inquiries aâ the lady s manner had a none the better for seeing you sort of air with it then you have found out nothing nothing my dear dick except that the conclusion at which you have so wisely arrived is completely in and approved of by the young lady s relatives you are telling me the truth said richard suspiciously you are not deceiving me you really do not know where is upon my honor i do not mr spoke truth though not the whole truth not only had declined to give him the slightest information as to the girl s present residence but â which he omitted to add â he had looked over the theatrical in the newspapers and even the in the era in vain the dramatic showed no star that either beamed or the name of chapter not yet the day of his s visit to ford s alley we may date richard s complete from what was called by his his unfortunate he never spoke and very seldom even thought of again but it must be confessed that his freedom â like that of most persons who have once been slaves â partook somewhat of the character of license his tastes for extravagance increased and very little of his money was spent in the advancement of missionary enterprise or to any other good purpose his nature was too genuine to admit of his sinking into the of he never pretended to be indifferent to all matters human and divine â though it must be confessed he concerned himself with the former rather to the of the latter he was not vicious in cold blood he did not in the existence of good men and women because his own mode of life did not bring him into contact with them but he walked in way of his own heart and the sight of his own eyes and they were evil the years were not many since he had rowed across the to see the s light lit but the difference between what he had been and what he had become â between man and boy â was his love for the girl now appeared a mere episode in his life and so far back or so it seemed as to have be longed almost to another state of existence if our bones and flesh and and change as we are told is the case every seven our thoughts and feelings and instincts space and they had not changed in richard s case for the better had ceased to pain him from its associations and even the gloom of the tower was not so oppressive as heretofore his nature had become less sympathetic he was sorry the poor governor so and entertained some apprehension that he showed symptoms of breaking up but his father s sombre and melancholy ways and even his behavior toward himself which was cold and as ever though as usual relieved by touches ,12
wild timid herd some part of the forest is selected a deer to which the deer are to be driven a great number of hill men and who thoroughly understand what they are about ore then sent to the farthest

them as they are always obliged to go with the wind which their natural instinct of self preservation makes them very unwilling to do and if they possibly can they always face it the implements of the

they stop their pursuit of the recover his track and hold him at bay all night should no one com to their relief that no beer inferior animal should attend the deer may be inferred from the â that a with his fore leg broken will often beat the a very singular result of the hind leg of a being broken is that in running he is almost certain to the other whether from the additional weight thrown upon it or some other cause seems not to be known red deer are as cunning as and as game in illustration of their cunning they have been observed to keep a dog at bay till he exhausted himself with barking and then waiting till he had his fill of water they bolted away refreshed and rested and soon left their behind it should be borne in mind that deer are powerless in the water the all important agent however of such as have the good fortune to take their pleasure among the in pursuit of the good deer is the rifle this description of piece if it may be so called or more properly sporting piece has like everything in undergone great improvement within the last twenty years it is now frequently two though it has been urged against this plan that the extreme impulse given to a ball by a whole turn in the of the barrel occasions a sacrifice of and consequently of range the by this mode of is made to two or three times as often as under the principle is foimd to be quite sufficient for projecting the plain ball with deer accuracy and effect with the common sort of rifle the best size for red deer shooting will be that which carries an ball the length of the barrel should be from two feet four to two feet six inches thb red desk talking the red deer is also known as the and the the height of the british is somewhere about four feet and he arrives at great weight

more but still this is in the main a sandy region which cannot compare with the of of or eastern there seems to be as rich and deep soil in some of the especially those of the south as almost anywhere and yet i fear the is doomed to find even this belt of and rolling land which stretches along the foot of the mountains to a width of perhaps twenty miles less the â the and productive than fertile it lies at such an elevation â from five thousand to six thousand feet above the ocean that though its are said to he moderate its springs cannot be early there was a fall of a foot of snow in this region on the th of may when ice formed to a quarter inch thickness on the plains and when summer suddenly sets in about the st of june there are hot by day and cool strong winds by night with a of petty thunder but little or no rain the gentle rain of last thursday in the mountains fell for a short time in sheets just at their say for a breadth of five and there ceased hardly a drop fell within five miles west or for any distance east of this place though the earth was soaked only ten miles further west hence the few who have commenced farms and gardens near this point tell me that their crops have made no progress for a week or two and can make none till they have rain i trust wheat and will do well here whenever they shall be allowed a fair chance and if very early on deeply land may do tolerably but corn though it comes up well and looks rank at present will hardly before frost even should it escape by while potatoes peas and most vegetables will probably require or yield but yet should the gold mines justify their present promise farming in the right at the base of these mountains even by the help of will to those who bring to it the requisite sagacity knowledge and richer rewards than elsewhere on earth everything that can the plains â tiie mountains be grown here will command or prices for years and lie who any calculated to and improve the gross mount diet of salt pork hot bread beans and coffee now necessarily all but universal in this region will be justly entitled to rank with public and the rocky mountains with their grand forests their grassy their frequent springs and dancing streams of the brightest sweetest water their pure elastic atmosphere and their game and fish are destined to be a favorite resort and home of civilized man i never visited a region where physical life could be more surely prolonged or fully enjoyed thousands who rush hither for gold will rush away again disappointed and disgusted as thousands have already done and yet the gold is in these mountains and the right men will gradually it i shall be mistaken if two or three millions arc not taken out this year and some ten millions in though all the time there will be as now a stream of rash heading away from the declaring that there is no gold there or next to none so it was in and in so it must be here where the obstacles to be overcome are greater and the for getting home decidedly better all men are not fitted by nature for gold dig yet thousands will not realize this until they have been convinced of it by sore experience any good should have been able to tell half the people who rushed hither so madly during the last two months that if these mountains had been half made of gold they never would get any of it except by their own proper business which was quite other than and still the long procession is crossing the and clear creek and pressing up the hill difficulty in mad pursuit of gold whereof not one fifth will carry back to the states so much as they brought away new leads will doubtless be discovered new veins be opened new or districts become the for it were absurd to suppose that little known as s running to clear creek the sole of gold worth working in all this and in time the rocky mountains will swarm with a hardy industrious energetic white population not gold alone but lead iron and i think silver or have already been discovered here and other valuable doubtless will be as the mountains are more thoroughly for as yet they have not been even run over those who are now intent on the immediate organization and admission of a new state may be too fast yet i believe the rocky mountains and their immediate vicinity â say between on the north and on the will within three years have a white population of one hundred thousand one half composed of men in the full vigor of their prime separated by deserts and waste places from the present states â obliged to rely on their own resources in any emergency and fully able to protect and govern themselves why not let them be a state so soon as reasonably may ,8
ufe a voluntary at least as advantageous to the latter as to the former i desired that the south should be made to comprehend and respect this truth i wished her to realize that the north could do without the south quite as well as the south could do without the north for the first breath of from the south into vigorous life the old spirit of compromise and at the north what will you do to save the union was asked of us as if we had committed some in for and which we must now by and to the justly alarmed and irritated south at once the attitude of the north became alarmed self every local election held during the two months succeeding our national triumph showed great gains conspicuous were denied the use of public halls or down if they attempted to speak influential citizens through meetings and letters the madness of and implored the south to stay her arm the north could have time to herself from with and her sympathy with her southern sister â that is her loyalty to the slave power an eminent southern john j having proposed as a new union saving compromise the running of the line of degrees minutes north latitude through our new to tlie pacific and the positive and of all south of that line to slavery forever the suggestion was grasped as an olive branch â even the weed the proposal to popular favor and acceptance as fair and reasonable the republican party â which had been called into existence by the opening of free soil to slavery â seemed in positive danger of its advent to power by giving a direct assent to the practical extension of slavery over a region far larger and more important than that surrendered by the bill in fact the attitude of the north during tho â how k two last months of was in lines of s to the passions â four his iti to amid the laid and back he knew not e en at the found had and the danger was imminent that if a popular vote have been had as was proposed on the com promise it would have prevailed by an overwhelming majority very few would have for it but very many would have refrained from at all while their would have brought their every man to the in its support and earned it by hundreds of thousands my own conviction from first to last was â there must at all events be no concession to slavery should it befall may be calamity but in slavery extension is guilt which the must in no case it had for an age been the study of the to make us of the north partners with them in the maintenance and profit or loss of their system slavery is quite as much your affair as ours they were accustomed to say in substance we own and work the you buy the cotton and sugar produced by their labor and sell us in return nearly all we and they eat drink and wear if they run away you help catch and return them now set us oflf a few hundred thousand miles more of territory whereon to work them and help ns to acquire c as we shall say we need them and we will largely extend our operations to our mutual benefit it was this extension that i was resolved at all to defeat but how good and true men met the whether earnest or affected in this square manly way you must obey the laws the union will not be surrendered and cannot be dissolved by force whoever attempt thus to it will have reason to repent of his behave yourselves or you will your recollections of a busy life to me as to some others a different course seemed advisable we said in substance you claim to be the southern people and rest your case on the vital principle proclaimed in our fathers declaration of independence â derive their just power from the consent of the governed we admit the principle â nay we affirm we glory in it but your case is not within it you are not the southern people you are not even a majority of the southern you are a violent desperate who have to clutch power and it for ends which the majority at heart condemn secure us a fair opportunity to state our side of the case and to ai e the i at issue before your people and we will abide their decision we a union of force â a union held together by let us be fairly heard and if your people decide that they choose to break away from us we will no obstacle to their peaceful from the union this was or was not in the abstract sound doctrine it is clear that those who uttered it exposed themselves to ready and grave w hich were y no advantage or profit to themselves their consolation was that they had done toward the spring tide of northern that set strongly in favor of through the of the compromise they were right at least in their assumption of fact

that of the head of any great establishment where numbers of are employed and to the management of which are added the of the care and complete of the liberty of his and their families his work was generally sufficiently to admit of enough personal independence to enable him to in the duties of hospitality but any master who had a successfully in old virginia conducted plantation was sure to

neighborhood which inspired the children with a reverence akin to awe which is not known at this present time it was not till the young people were grown that this reverence lost the awe and became based only upon affection and admiration then for the first time they dared to jest with her then for the first time they took in that she had been like them once young and gay and pleasure loving

for at this season of the year there was hardly a sufficient depth of water to float a boat of her size if she stuck the party would get into the small boat and thus lightened the might be floated into the other arm of the lake a pleasant day indeed for a sail and in imagination he followed the down the lake past its different castles castle and castle and church island the island on which â the famous poet â had lived it seemed to him strange that he had never thought of visiting the ruined church when he lived close by at the northern end of the lake his time used to be entirely taken up with attending to the wants of his poor people and the first year he spent in he had thought only of the possibility of the government to build a bridge across the strait that bridge was badly wanted all the western side of the lake was cut off from railway communication was the but to get to one had to go round the the lake â lake either by the northern or the southern end and was always a question which was the longer abbey or by the bridge of many people said the southern road was shorter but the difference wasn t more than a mile if that and father preferred the northern road for it took him by his s house and he could always stop there and give his horse a feed and a rest and he liked to the abbey in which he had said mass for so long and in which mass had always been said for a thousand years even since had it the sheltered by an arch the congregation kneeling under the open sky whether it rained or the of the abbey and the of the strait were the two things that the parish was really interested in he had tried when he was in to obtain the s consent and was trying now he did not know that he was succeeding any better and father reflected a while on the peculiar temperament of their and getting down from the rock on which he had been sitting he wandered along the sunny shore thinking of the many letters he had addressed to the board of works on the subject of the bridge the board believed or pretended to believe that the parish could not afford the bridge as well might it be urged that a could not afford without doubt a public meeting should be held and some little indignation father began to think th public opinion should be roused and organized it w for him to do this he was the people s natural leader the lake for many months he had done nothing in the matter why he didn t know himself perhaps he needed a holiday perhaps he no longer believed the government susceptible to public opinion perhaps he had lost faith in the people themselves the people were the same always the people never change only individuals change and at the end of the sandy spit where some pines liad grown and he stood looking across the â very lake wondering if his had begun to the change that had come over him since rose left the parish as her name came into his mind his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of voices and turning from the lake he saw two wood coming down a little path through the bushes he often hid himself in the woods when he saw somebody coming but he couldn t do so now without betraying his intention and he stayed where he was the women passed on bent under their loads whether they saw him or not he couldn t tell they passed near enough for him to recognize them and he remembered that they were in church the day he had alluded to rose in his sermon a hundred yards farther on the women put down their loads and sat down to rest and father began to think what their conversation might be his habit of wandering away by himself had no doubt been noticed and once it was noticed it would become a topic of conversation and what they are saying now is ah sure he never has been the same man since he preached against the and what should he be doing by the lake if fear that she has the lake made away with herself weren t on his mind perhaps they are right he said to himself and he up the shore hoping that as soon as he was out of sight the women would cease to speak of him and rose all the morning he had been trying to avoid of her but now as he he could not put back the memory of the day he had met her for the first time was in the summer as nearly as possible two years a to day was the of may it was certainly later in the year it must have been in june for the day x very hot and he had been riding fast not wishing to keep s dinner waiting as he pushed his through the gate he saw the great cheery r father peter with a face like an apple walking up down under the reading his and t this moment he could hear his loud rough voice and feel the grasp of his great hand but he was earlier than he expected and father peter said that sign to them when her dinner was ready and they walked in the pleasant shade of the trees it must have been in june for the were in th field opposite in the field known as the priest s field though father peter had never it there had never been such weather in ireland before the sky was like boiled and he remembered how eagerly ,3
but a poor use of it in his history for a piece of composition never came from any man s pen however he was accurate at least though far from possessing the brilliancy or philosophy of mr but if knew the history of the chair rejoined his heart must have been stirred by it it must indeed said grandfather it would be entertaining and instructive at the present day to imagine what were mr s thoughts as he looked back upon the long vista of events with which this chair was so remarkably connected and grandfather allowed his fancy to shape out an image of lieutenant governor sitting in an evening reverie by his fireside and meditating on the changes that had slowly passed around the chair a devoted would heave no sigh for the of the original republican government the purest that the world had seen with which the colony began its exist ence while the grim and stern old as the of his native land he would not wish to recall them from their graves nor to awaken again that king resisting spirit which he imagined to be laid asleep with them by ic s chair for ever and all these had had their day ages might come and go but never again would the people s place a republican governor in their ancient chair of state coming down to the epoch of the second thought of the ship carpenter springing from the lowest of the people and to the station in the land but he smiled to perceive that this governor s example would awaken no turbulent ambition in the lower orders for it was a king s gracious boon alone that made the ship carpenter a ruler rejoiced to mark the gradual growth of an aristocratic class to whom the common people as in duty bound were learning humbly to resign the honors and authority of state he saw â or else deceived himself â that throughout this epoch the people s disposition to self government had been growing weaker through long and now existed only as a faint feeling the lieutenant governor s reverie had now come down to the period at which he himself was sitting in the historic chair he endeavored to throw his glance forward over the coming years there probably he saw visions of hereditary rank for himself and other aristocratic he saw the fertile fields of new england by ic grandfather s chair out among a few great and descending by from generation to generation he saw the people a race of dependent on their lords he saw stars and castles but added grandfather turning to the lieutenant governor s castles were built nowhere but among the red embers of the fire before which he was sitting and just as he had constructed a residence for himself and his posterity the fire rolled down upon the hearth and it to ashes grandfather now looked at his watch which hung within a beautiful little temple supported by four columns he then laid his hand on the golden locks of little whose head had sunk down upon the arm of our illustrious chair to bed to bed dear child said he grandfather has put you to sleep already by his stories about these famous old people d by grandfather s chair part iii chapter i on the evening of new year s day grandfather was walking to and fro across the listening to the rain which beat hard against the windows the blast shook the as if a strong man were to force his entrance into the comfortable room with every puff of the wind the fire leaped upward from the hearth laughing and rejoicing at the shrieks of the wintry storm meanwhile grandfather s chair stood in its customary place by the fireside the bright blaze gleamed upon the fantastic figures of its back and shone through the open work so that a complete pattern was thrown upon the opposite side of the room sometimes for a moment or two the shadow remained immovable as if it were painted on the wall then all at once it began to quiver and leap and by ic s chair vith a motion anon seeming to ber that these were unworthy of such a dignified and venerable chair it suddenly stood still but soon it began to dance anew only see how grandfather s chair is dancing cried little and she ran to the wall and tried to catch hold of the flickering shadow for to children of five years old a shadow seems almost as real as a substance i wish said grandfather would sit down in the chair and finish its history if the children had been looking at grandfather they would have noticed that he paused in his walk across the room when made this remark the kind old gentleman was ready and willing to resume his stories of departed times but he had resolved to wait till his should request him to proceed in order that they might find the instructive history of the chair a pleasure and not a task grandfather said i am tired to death of this dismal rain and of hearing the wind roar in the chimney i have had no good time all day it would be better to hear stories about the chair than to sit doing nothing and thinking of nothing to say the truth our friend was very much out of humor with the storm because it had kept him all day within doors and by ic grandfather s him from making a trial of a splendid which grandfather had given him for a new year s gift as all now a days must have a name the one in question had been honored with the title of grandfather s chair which was painted in golden letters on each of the sides greatly admired the construction of the new vehicle and felt ,2

brothers and sisters to the i said woman i have no need of thee and when joseph of returned to me after a long attendance by his father s bedside â i the brook his father had lain in a great sickness for many months it was through joseph s care that he had been saved from death joseph was a good son i told him he must learn to hate his father and his mother if he would become worthy to follow me but my passion was so great in those days that i did not see that my teaching was not less than against god for god has created the world for us to live in it and he has put love of parents into our hearts because he wishes us to love our parents and if he has put into the heart of man love of woman and into the heart of woman love of man it is because he wishes both to enjoy that love i fear to think of the things i said at that time but i must speak of them one man asked me before he left all things to follow me if he might not bury his father first i answered leave the dead to bury their dead and to another who said my hand is at the plough may i not drive it to the i answered leave all things and follow me my teaching grew more and more violent it is not peace i said that i bring to you but a sword and i come as a brand wherewith to set the world in flame i said too that i came to divide the house to set father against mother brother against brother sister against sister i can see that my remembrance of him who once was wounds the dear brethren with whom i have lived so long i knew it would be hard for you to hear that an had broken the rules of a holy order and it is hard for me to stand before you and tell that i who was instructed by in all the pious traditions of our race should have against god s creation and god s own self you will thrust me through the door as an unworthy brother saying go live in the wilderness and i shall not cry out against my through the hills and valleys but continue to repent my sins in silence till death leads me into silence that never ends you are the brook perhaps asking yourselves why i returned here was it to hide myself from and the jews no but to repent of the evil seed that i had sown that i returned here and it was because he wished me to repent that god took me down from the cross and cured me of my wounds in joseph s house and sent me here to lead the sheep over the hills and it was he who put this last confession into my mouth it seems to me that in telling this story brethren i am doing but the work of god no man very far from the work that god has to him but in the time i am telling i was so exalted by the many miracles which i had performed by the power of god or the power of a demon i know not which that i encouraged my to speak of me as the son of david though i knew myself to be the son of joseph the carpenter and when i rode into and the people palms before me and called out the son of david and joseph said to me let them not call thee the son of david i answered in my pride if they did not call it forth the stones themselves f would in the days i am telling pride lifted me above myself and i went about asking who i was moses or the promised to the jews a madman a madman or possessed by some evil spirit paul cried out and rising to his feet he rushed out of the but nobody rose to detain him some of the raised their heads and a moment after the interruption was forgotten a day passed in the great exaltation and hope and one evening i took bread and broke it saying that i was the bread of life that came down from heaven and that ate of it had everlasting life given to him after saying these words a great fell upon me and calling my together i asked them to come to the garden of with me and it was while asking god s the brook forgiveness for my that the and agents of the priests came and took me prisoner at the touch of their hands the belief that i was the promised to the jews rose up in my heart again and when the priests asked me if i were the christ the son of the blessed i answered i am and ye shall see tl son of man sitting on the right hand of god and it not till i was hanging on the cross for upwards of two he that the belief i had come down from heaven to do our father s will faded again much that i had said seemed to me evil and and feeling myself about to die i called out to my father who answered my call at once bringing joseph of to the foot of the cross to ask the for my body for burial but the could not deliver me unto him without s order and both went to and he gave me to joseph for burial nor did our father allow the to be lifted till joseph entered the tomb to kiss me for the last time it was then he opened my eyes and i saw joseph standing by me a lantern ,3

spring when its volume is greater its quality is probably better once we stopped by a small brook tumbling down from high adjacent mountains on the left and i drank my fill of its warm sweet water but

ten times as many went out of their way to gaze at the procession though that was not much our new york fire department could beat it so could our odd fellows â then the most perfect order was preserved throughout everything was done in season and without no accident occurred to mar the and the general feeling was one of hearty satisfaction if it were a new thing to see a queen court and aristocracy engaged in doing marked honor to industry they certainly performed gracefully the parts allotted them and with none of the awkwardness or which novel situations are expected to excuse but was the play well the sovereign in a is of course always in order to be honored for doing his whole duty to be honored more if he does more than his duty prince s sphere as the sovereign s is very limited and he shows rare sense and prudence in never a desire to it i think few men live who could hold his and position and retain so entirely the sincere respect and esteem of the british nation his labors in this exhibition began early and have been persistent and effective or thb any of the fair in which he did not figure would have done him injustice the queen appears to be personally popular in a more direct and positive sense i cannot remember that any one act of her public life has ever been condemned by the public sentiment of the country almost every body here appears to esteem it a condescension for her to open the exhibition as though it were a parliament and with far more of personal exertion and on her part and while i must regard her as one rather behind the intelligence of this age and likely to go out of fashion at no distant day yet i am sure that change will not come through her fault i was glad to see her in the to day and hope she enjoyed it while to the enjoyment of others but let us reverse the glass for a moment the ludicrous the the are not excluded from the exhibition they cannot be excluded from any complete picture of its opening the queen we will say was here by right divine by right of womanhood by universal any how you please the could not have spared her but in the first grand of industry ought not industry to have had some representation some vital recognition in her share of the if the queen h d come in state to the horse guards to review the of her military forces no one would doubt that the duke should figure in the with a brilliant staff of and surrounding him so if she were proceeding to open parliament her fitting attendants would be ministers and of state but what have her gentleman of sword and state lords in waiting master of the horse earl groom of the stole master of the and such uncouth to do with a grand exhibition of the fruits of industry what in their capacity have these and theirs ever at bu had to do with industry unless to burden it or with its but to or destroy them the mistress of the robes would be in place if she ever fashioned any robes even for the queen so would the ladies of the if they did anything with beds except to sleep in them as the fact is their presence only served to strengthen the presumption that not merely their offices but that of itself is an and all should have deceased with the era to which they properly belonged it was well indeed that ton should have a proud place in the procession but he held it in no representative capacity he was there not in behalf of architecture but of the crystal palace to have rendered the expressive and really a tribute to industry the posts of honor next the queen s person should have been confided on this occasion to the children of of and their s real while instead of and foreign the of of of of of c with the and to whom the world is indebted for electric c c should have been specially invited to swell the royal to pass over all these and summon instead the descendants of some dozen lucky robbers none of whom ever contemplated the personal doing of any real work as even a remote possibility and any of whom would feel insulted by a report that his father or grandfather invented the steam engine or spinning is not the way to honor industry the queen s c would have been far more in place in the procession than her gold stick silver stick and kindred and yet empty and as the conception of this may seem and is there is nevertheless opening of thi and hope in it the world does move o carrying onward even those who forced you to deny the truth you had we may well say that these gentlemen in ribbons and stars cannot truly honor labor while they would deem its performance by their own sons a degradation but the of these and would have deemed themselves as much by in this royal to and makers as these men would by being compelled to the cloth and the iron themselves patience impetuous souls the better day though the morning air is chilly we shall be able to elect something else than to the before this century is out and the right of every man to live by labor â consequently to a place

old indeed that the front forth as if the timber were a little weary at last of standing erect so long but the state of repair is so perfect and there is such an indescribable aspect of continuous vitality within the system of this aged house that you feel confident that there may be safe shelter yet and perhaps for centuries to come under its time honoured roof and on a bench enjoying the sunshine and looking into the street of as from a life apart a few old men are generally to be seen wrapped in long on which you may detect the glistening of a silver representing the bear and ragged staff these decorated are some of the twelve brethren of s hospital â a community which to day under the identical modes that were established for it in the reign of queen elizabeth and of course many features of a social life that has vanished almost everywhere else the edifice itself dates from a much older period than the charitable institution of which it is now the home it was the about seat of a far back in the middle ages and continued so till henry tamed all the of england out of doors and put the most of his into their vacant in many instances the old had chosen the of their so well and built them on such a broad system of beauty and convenience that their lay occupants found it easy to convert them into stately and comfortable homes and as such they still exist with something of the antique reverence lingering about them the structure now before us seems to have been first granted to sir who perhaps intended like other men to establish his household gods in the whence he had thrown down the images of saints and to lay his hearth where an altar had stood but there was probably a natural reluctance in those days when so lately must needs have retained an influence over all but the most characters to bring one s hopes of domestic prosperity and a fortunate into direct hostility with the awful claims of the ancient religion at all events there is still a superstitious idea a and a belief that the possession of former church property has drawn a curse along with it not only among the posterity of those to whom it was originally granted but wherever it has subsequently been transferred even if honestly bought and paid for there are now some of the old who appear to indulge a species of pride in the strange deaths and ugly shapes of misfortune that have occurred among their and may be supposed likely to dog their own pathway down the ages of whether sir in the beef eating days of old harry and elizabeth was a nervous man and subject to apprehensions of this kind i cannot tell but it is certain that he speedily rid himself of the spoils of the church and that within twenty years afterwards the edifice became the property of the famous earl of brother of the earl of he devoted the ancient religious to a charitable use it with an ample old home and making it the home of twelve poor honest and war broken soldiers mostly his own and natives either of or these or others like them still occupy their and haunt the time darkened and galleries of the hospital leading a life of old fashioned comfort wearing the old fashioned and the identical silver which the earl of gave to the original twelve he is said to have been a bad man in his day but he has succeeded in one good deed into what was to him a distant future on the projecting story over the arched entrance there is the date and several coats of arms either the or those of his kindred and immediately above the doorway a stone of the bear and staff passing through the arch we find ourselves in a or enclosed court such as always formed the central part of a great family residence in queen elizabeth s time and earlier there can hardly be a more perfect specimen of such an establishment than s hospital the is a sort of sky hall to which there is convenient access from all parts of the house the four inner fronts with their high steep roofs and sharp look into it from antique windows and through open and galleries along the sides and there seems to be a richer display of devices and ornaments in oak and more fantastic shapes of the timber than on the side toward the street on the wall opposite the arched entrance are the following such moral rules i presume as were deemed most essential for the daily of the community â all â â â and again as if this latter

besides it does not just now concern us i have always thought that one of the wisest in the sacred is that which describes the effect of matrimony upon a female of this sort she is almost as bad as she can be to start with i don t mean of course that she is not virtuous she is much too to be otherwise cold cruel and mean but having contrary to all expectations secured a husband she becomes infinitely worse she is one of the three things says solomon the other two are by comparison for which the earth is â an odious woman when she is married he had a large experience of matrimony and spoke no doubt as he found but why oh why do men ever give such women the opportunity of becoming worse than they were this however is a the woman i have in my mind was by no means such a person as solomon had in his yet no one when he did it at least could form the faintest conception why richard married her it was a question that agitated female in her neighbourhood and far beyond it at the time more than any other though the of the parish was with by the s wife that very month and carried off to the united states was a m a â c the city which is ne m o x iâ y why he married her in its expressions called him warm but ke was cold and for all i know to the as as snow he spoke with a solemnity aiid emphasis â though he never said an worth hearing â which was particularly i have looked in the face of the bore the voice of the simple i know i have welcomed the to my door i have by the side of the slow but richard was to my mind the most wearisome button of them all most of his class are free from their tongues betray them even to the most you feel at that they have too great a command of language or rather as a justly respected lady puts it in her recent that language has too great a command of but the of mr richard s manner was such that you felt that something must be coming of his eloquence though nothing did however miss didn t seem to mind it it is indeed amazing what women will stand in the way of and her mother liked it at first i thought she only affected to do so and was sacrificing her daughter s sake but i do believe she liked it she reasoned perhaps justly enough that no man would venture to talk so about all unless he had great possessions and this con made his conversation not only to her but satisfactory was rather a pretty girl dark ff i â ne eyes of which she weu od tl s why he married her could not only see with them but play with them as spanish ladies have the reputation of playing with their i have said the reputation â though that is perhaps hardly the right word â but for my own part i cannot conceive how any man can be caught with a fan any more than with a in the case of an ugly woman a good large fan which didn t fold up would of course give her a chance but what can be the good of it when there is nothing to hide indeed are said to prefer a revolving which now you see and now you don t to a steady one but that is because it cannot be mistaken for a ship s light a woman can scarcely be mistaken for anything unless it s a girl as sailors say of a certain or for all we know philosophic sea bird one may catch a with anything and perhaps even a fan may catch a fool but mr richard who was certainly no fool would never have been caught that way but a woman s eyes they are very different and in miss s case had no pretensions of concealment about them it is true she occasionally dropped them but they didn t fall very far and i think that mr liked them better so than even when they were regarding him another favourite trick of theirs with the most adoration he was a man who preferred not to be gazed at too intently in which he was quite consistent for he himself never looked any one straight in the face he would button hole you as i have said but instead of fixing you with a glittering eye as is the manner of most would proceed as it to w ie universal nature upon the object k v why he married her o thus secured mrs used to affirm that this arose from sh i never of course dispute a lad s word and may even from courtesy have gone so far as to say very but if so it was with what persons of much higher principles than myself term a mental even the philosopher who a from the depths of self consciousness would surely have had a difficulty in entertaining the idea of a shy privately indeed i always suspected mr richard of being a bit of a rogue he was too wise and prudent for so young a man â he was but five and thirty at the most â and also too rich it is all very well to be the of one s own but the stone must not be placed upon them too early a famous and not indifferent to the claims of wealth used to be fond of trotting out a certain nightmare of his i once he would say a most delightful dream i thought i was the very richest man in england there was no end to ,12
passage for he is not an old man what instinct him to bear his dark life is he afraid to kill himself does this fear spring from physical or from religious motives fear of hell surely no other motive would enable him to endure his life in my for all life but my own i thought i could estimate the value of the great mockery and i asked myself angrily why he persisted in living i asked myself why i helped him to live it would be better that he should throw himself at once into the river and this was reason talking to me and it told me that the most charitable act i could do would be to help him over the but behind reason there is instinct and in obedience to an impulse which i could not weigh or appreciate i went to the blind man and put money into his hand the small coin through his fingers they were so cold that he could not retain it and i had to pick it from the ground sir can you tell sir what time it is this little question was my he and i wanted to know the time of day i asked him why he wanted to know the time and he told me because that evening a friend was coming to fetch him and wondering who that friend might be and hoping he might tell me i asked him about his case of expressing a hope that he sold them he answered that he was doing a nice bit of trading the boys about here are a trouble he said but the policeman on the beat is a friend of mine and he watches them and makes them count the they take the other day they robbed me and he gave them such a that i don t think they ll take my again you see sir i keep the money i take for the in the left pocket and the money that is given to me i keep in the right pocket in this way i know if my accounts are right when i make them up in the evening now where in what lonely room does he sit making up his accounts but not wishing to seem i turned the conversation i suppose you know some of the by yes i know a tidy few there s one gentleman who gives me a penny every day but he s gone abroad i hear and sixpence a week is a big drop as i had given him a penny a day all the summer i assumed he was speaking of me and my sixpence a week meant a day s dinner perhaps two days dinner it was only necessary for me to withhold my charity to give him ease he would hardly be able to live without my charity and if one of his other were to do likewise the world would be freed from a life that i could not feel to be of any value so do we judge the world if we rely on our reason but instinct like a child and like a child and my instinct begged me to this poor man to give him a penny every day to find out what his condition was and to stop for a chat every time i gave him my penny i had obeyed my instinct all the summer and now reason had reason was in rebellion and for a long time i avoided or seemed to avoid the passage where the blind man sat for eight or nine hours glad to receive but never asking for i think i forgot the blind man for several months i only remembered him when i was sitting at home or when i was at the other side of the town and sometimes i thought i made myself little excuses not to pass through the passage our motives are vague complex and many and one is never quite sure why one does a thing and if i were to say that i did not give the blind man that winter because i believed it better to deprive him of his means of and force him out of life than to help him to remain in life and nâ fer i should he saying what was certainly jet the idea was in mj mind and i experienced more than one of conscience when i passed through the passage i experienced remorse when i hurried past him too selfish to mj coat for every time i happened to pass him it was or blowing very hard and every time i hurried away trying to find reasons why he bore his miserable life i hurried to my business my head full of chatter about st telling myself that he saw god far away at the end of the sky his immortal hands filled with immortal reason about the compensation of celestial but instinct told me that the blind man standing in the stone passage knew of no such miraculous as the winter advanced as the winds grew my of the passage grew more marked and one day i stopped to think and ask myself why i avoided it there was a faint warmth in the sky and i heard my heart speaking quite distinctly and it said go to the blind man â what matter about your ten minutes delay you have been unhappy since you refrained from giving and the blind beggar can feel the new year beginning you see sir i have added some shirt buttons and to the i don t know how they will go but one never knows till one tries then he told me it was that destroyed his and he was only eighteen at the time you must have suffered very much when they told you your sight was going yes sir i had the for six weeks what do ,3

it is wrong to steal government timber taking from the government is with them the same as from nature and their no mo in cutting timber from the wild forests than in drawing water from a lake or river as for and of forests it seems as silly and needless to them as protection and of the ocean be both appearing to be boundless and inexhaustible the special land agents employed by the gen land office to protect the public domain from timber are supposed to collect testimony to sustain and to such on behalf of the which is represented by the district but timber thieves of the western class are seldom convicted for the good reason that most of the who try such cases are our national as as those on trial the effect of the present confused and unjust system has been to place almost the whole population in opposition to the government and as of its as shown by mr we need only state that during the seven years from to the value of the timber reported stolen from the government lands was and the amount recovered was while the cost of the services of special agents alone was to which must be added the expense of the trials thus for nearly thirty seven million dollars worth t f timber the government got less than nothing and the value of that consumed by running fires during the same period without benefit even to thieves was probably over two hundred millions of dollars land and of the interior have repeatedly called attention to this state of affairs and asked to the requisite for reform but busied with etc has given no heed to these or other appeals and our forests the most valuable and the most of all the natural resources of the country are being robbed and burned more rapidly than ever the annual for so called protection service is hardly sufficient to keep twenty five timber agents in the fields and as far as any efficient the forests tt of timber is concerned these agents might as well be timber that a change from robbery and ruin to a per rational policy is needed nobody with the slightest knowledge of american forests will deny in the east and along the northern â pacific coast where the is abundant comparatively few care keenly what becomes of the trees so long as fuel and lumber are not dear but in the rocky mountains and â and where the forests are and where the of the depends upon public opinion is growing stronger every year in favor of permanent by the government of all the forests that cover the sources of the streams even in these regions long accustomed to steal are now willing and anxious to buy lumber for their mills under cover of law some possibly from a late second growth of honesty but most especially the mill simply because it no longer pays to steal where all may not only steal but also destroy and in particular because it costs about as much to steal timber for one as for ten and therefore the ordinary can no longer with the large many of the find that timber is already becoming scarce and dear on a lor the b j k now our national the hills their mills and thej too are asking for protection of forests at against fire the going also are beginning to realize that when the timber is stripped from the mountains the streams dry op in and are in winter that soil and slips os with the trees so of course they are coming into the ranks of tree friends of all the magnificent forests around the great lakes once the property of the united states scarcely any belong to it now they have disappeared in lumber and smoke mostly smoke and the government got not one cent for them only the land they were growing on was considered valuable and two and a half dollars an acre was charged for it here and there in the southern states there are still considerable of government land but these are comparatively unimportant only the forests of the west are significant in size and value and these although stiu great are rapidly vanishing last summer of the forests of the pacific coast range the

they are true to you â â â to me your reverence i don t rightly understand i want to know if you think our lord put a gold crown on your head to day to be sure he did your reverence if he did where is it where is it your reverence it is with him to be sure he wouldn t be leaving it on my head and me walking about the parish â that wouldn t be reasonable at au i m thinking he doesn t want me to be robbed there is no one in the parish who d rob you maybe would come out of another parish if i had a g ld crown on my head and such a crown as he put upon it â i m sorry you didn t see it but your reverence was saying the holy mass at the time and she fell on her knees and clung to his and you saw the crown i had it on my head your reverence and you heard the saints singing yes and i ll tell you what they were singing and she began something like that your reverence you don t believe me but we have only our ears and our eyes to guide us i don t say i don t believe you but you may be deceived deceiving your reverence or i ve been deceived all my life and now your reverence if you ve no more business with me i will go for they do be waiting in the chapel yard to hear me tell them about the crown that was put upon my head well i want you to understand that i cannot have you interrupting the mass i cannot permit it the visions may be true or not true but you must not interrupt the mass the opened the door of the slipped through and the priest took off his as he did so he noticed that the s eyes were at the window watching and when the priest looked he saw the people gathering about and when he came out of the no one noticed him was listening to she s out of her mind he said she s as good as mad what did she tell me â that our lord put a crown on her head one withdrew without answering another went away saying well i suppose your reverence knows best he heard another say well after all doesn t she hear the saints singing and next day there were people from asking after and father had to send for her though he feared all the honour that was being shown to her would turn her head and lead her into further on the other hand were coming in and he could not close his mind to the fact that it was who enabled him to furnish his church with and holy pictures he received two fine statues of our lady and st joseph in different coloured â st joseph in a purple our lady in a blue and there were gold stars on it he placed these two statues on the two side and fell to thinking of the many things he wanted and that he could get through for the sake of these things he must let her remain in but she could not be allowed to interrupt the mass and he must be allowed to pass in and out of his church without extravagant salutation now he was going home to his breakfast and a young man extremely interested in art was coming to breakfast with him and as soon as they entered the church they would be by this old woman who would follow them about asking them to look at her window telling them her visions which might or might not be true she had a of hiding herself â he often came upon her suddenly behind the pillars and sometimes he found her in the now shall i tell him about or shall i take my chance that she may not be in the church this morning he remembered that the young man was very learned in walter and cathedral and father feared he would cut a poor figure in the discussion for he could not fix his attention he could think only of and when he and his visitor walked down to the new church he thought he had done well to keep bis own counsel he could not see the old woman his fears subsided and he called the young man s attention to the altar that had been specially designed for his church the young man was interested in it and had begun to tell the priest of the he had seen in italy when a hand was laid upon his shoulder suddenly your honour will be well rewarded if you ll come to my window now why should i be telling him a lie your reverence she threw herself at the priest s feet and him to believe that the saints had been with her and that every word she was speaking was the truth if you don t go away at once i ll not allow you inside the church to morrow the young man looked at the priest surprised at his and the priest said she has become a great trial to us at come aside and i ll tell you about her and when the priest had told the young man about the window the young man asked if would have to be sent away i hope not for if she were separated from her window she would certainly die it came out of her out of the money she made out of chickens and what has become of the chickens she has forgotten all about them and they ve wan away or died she has been and lives now in an on the bits of bread and the ,3
his own were magnificent as the stars amongst which his spirit wandered and had his mode of conveying these to the minds of others been equal to their own original he would have stood pre eminent amongst our poets in the region of power in order to prove that the poetry of young is too massive and complex in its to be within the compass of natural and ordinary association it is unnecessary to quote many instances those who are most familiar with his writings â even his greatest admirers must acknowledge that in one line of his works they meet with matter which if diffused and enlarged upon would fill pages better calculated to please as well as to instruct i the poetry of life how poor how rich how how august how how is i how wonder he who made him d in our make extremes t from natures mix d exquisite of different worlds d link in being s endless chain from nothing to the deity thus far the mind may keep pace with the writer and especially by the last two lines must be impressed with ideas at once clear imaginative and sublime those which immediately follow are less happy a beam ethereal and d though and d still dim miniature of greatness absolute an heir of glory i a frail child of dust i helpless immortal insect infinite a worm a god i tremble at myself and in myself am lost one instance more and we turn to passages of a different character blush at terror for a death which gives thee to repose in where sparkle angels minister and more than angels share and raise and crown and the birth bloom bursts of bliss it is really a relief to pass on from this laborious collection of ideas to instances of more perfect which also abound in the works of the same poet what can exceed in power and beauty his first address to night night goddess from her throne in ray less majesty now stretches forth her leaden o er a ring world how dread and darkness how profound nor eye nor listening ear an object finds creation sleeps tis as the general pulse of life stood still and nature made a pause an pause prophetic of her end again his appeal to the divine of his solemn thoughts is majesty and power man s author end law and judge thine all day thine and thine this gloomy night with all her wealth and all her radiant worlds what night eternal but a frown from what heaven s glory but thy smile and shall not praise be thine not human praise while heaven s high host in live o may i breathe no longer than breathe my soul in praise to him who gave my soul and all her infinite of prospect through the shades of hell great love by thee o moat moat d where shall that praise begin which ne er should end where er turn what claim on all applause how is night s mantle o er how richly wrought with attributes divine what wisdom shines what love this midnight pomp this gorgeous arch with golden words built with divine ambition to thee for others this thou apart above beyond o tell me mighty blind where art thou shall i into the deep call to the sun or ask the roaring winds for their creator shall i question loud the thunder if in that the almighty dwells or holds he storms in d and bids fierce wheel his rapid car t the he whose nod is nature s birth and nature s shield the shadow of his hand her dissolution his suspended smile the great last d high he in darkness from splendour borne by gods unseen un ess through lustre his glory to created glory bright as that to central horrors he on all that and young s description of truth is also strongly by power bee from her as from aa humble truth radiant goddess on my soul and puts delusion s dusky train to flight the mist our passions raise from objects low and and shows the real estimate of which no man ever off the veil from virtue s rising temptation in a thousand lies truth bids me look on men as autumn and all they for as the summer s driven by the lighted by her i my horizon gain new powers bee things invisible feel things remote am present with think to man so foreign as the joys d so much his as those beyond the grave all it is not so much in extended passages as in distinct thoughts and single expressions that we feel and acknowledge the power of this dignified and majestic writer silence and darkness sisters is a striking illustration of how great an extent of may be embodied in a few simple and well chosen words and it is unquestionably to beauties of this description that young is indebted for his high rank amongst our poets the same faculty of mind is exhibited under a different character in the writings of pope power as an impulse is less apparent here but in its mode of operation it is more uniform and efficient pope is less an than young and therefore he pays more regard to means whilst the agency by which these means are brought power to bear upon their object seems to be in silent pomp the genius of young gives us the idea of continued extraordinary and sometimes ineffectual effort â even in the dead of night counting the stars with darkness and grasping at while we imagine tliat of pope seated on a ne of majesty collecting and the elements of mind by authority rather than by direct force the power of young that of a an earthquake or a storm of thunder â that of pope is like the flow of a broad and potent ,7
heard any of the music you sing i have never heard but the italian and or have you never sung very little i am what is called a dramatic the only italian opera i ve sung is do you know it yes i ve sung â not in in but surely you admire â the for instance is not that beautiful it is no doubt very effective but it is considered very common now of the opera then the from i ve sung margaret ah and as she the jewel song she watched the reverend mother s face and was certain that the had heard the music on the stage but at that moment the bell rang had forgotten the and as she walked towards the she asked the reverend mother to repeat them once again so that she might have them by heart she excused herself saying how difficult was the of religious forms for those who live in the world by â after dinner she wrote two letters one was to her father the other was to and having directed the letters she imagined the arrangement to be some what irregular after she would ask what time the letters left the and looking across the abyss which separated them she saw her passionate self past and s little from the school room to the it seemed strange to her that she never had what might be called a girl friend but she had arrived at a time when a woman friend was a necessity and it now suddenly occurred to her that there would be something wonderfully sweet and satisfying in the love of a woman younger than herself she felt that the love of this innocent creature who knew nothing who never would know anything and who therefore would suspect nothing would help her to forget her past as wished she felt a sympathy awaken in her for her own sex which she had never known before and this yearning was confounded in a desire to be among those who knew nothing of her past now she was glad that she had refrained from taking the reverend mother into her confidence and she wondered how much had told her the day they had walked in the garden it relieved her to remember that he knew very little except what she had told him in confession knocked she answered come in it was mother and another i hope we re not interrupting but you re reading i see no i was thinking and glad of the interruption she let the book fall on her knees pray come in mother and rose to detain her the entered very handed them chairs and as she did so she remarked the tall who followed mother and whose face expressed so much energy good afternoon miss i hope you slept well last night and did not find your bed too thank you mother i liked my bed i slept very well drew two chairs forward and mother introduced to sister mary john and while she explained that she had heard from the by that had to at john sat watching her large brown wide open her eagerness was even a little and smiled through her growing liking for she was any other she had seen were usually formal and placid hut sister mary john was so herself that n the others presented feeble of the mother s manner her walk and speech sister mary john continued to along to cross her legs to swing her arms to lean forward and interrupt when she was interested in the conversation when she was not she did not attempt to hide her thought that she must be about eight and twenty or thirty the eyes were brown and and the eyebrows seemed very t and black in the sallow complexion all the features were large but a little of the radiant smile that had lit up all her features when she came forward to greet still lingered on her face now and then she seemed to grow impatient and then she forgot her impatience and the smile floated back again at last her opportunity came and she seized it eagerly fm ashamed miss we sang so badly this morning our little choir can do better than that was interested the organ was very wed played did you think so i have not sufficient time for practice but i love music and am longing to hear you sing but the mother says that you have brought no music with you i hear said mother that you do not care for s ave maria if the mother wishes me to sing it i shall be delighted to do so if sister mary john has the music sister mary john shook her head and said that she quite understood that miss did not approve of the liberty of writing any melody over s beautiful besides it required a the conversation then turned on the music at st joseph s sister mary john listened breaking suddenly in with some question regarding she had never heard any of his music would miss lend her some was there nothing of his that th could sing in the by oi i do not know anything of his written for two voices ton might play the other parts on the organ but i m afraid it would sound not a little ridiculous but have you heard the sing the plain chant they pause in the middle of the verse â that is the tradition is it not meanwhile mother sat forgotten noticed her before sister mary john and addressed an observation to her but mother said she knew nothing about music and that they were to go on talking as if she weren t there but a mere listener is a dead weight in a conversation and whenever s eyes went that way she could see that mother was thinking of something else ,3

of opinion he had grave doubts ought any one to allow themselves to be imposed upon asked not giving him time to speak is it the duty of a man who knows he is in the right to pay out a sum of money for the benefit ft of others just to avoid standing up in a court and defending himself against them not in that view of the matter certainly he answered then he added i am sure your father will consider the case from all sides and do what he thinks just grew as earnest as had done it is not exactly that she said he has paid them once and a good round sum too for what was no loss to them whatever now they have gone to work and him for much more it was no doings of his they have entered on it of their own accord it seems to me that he ought in the interest of others who may be imposed upon in that way at other times to teach them that this sort of thing does not pay those who engage in it admitted that there was something in that he wondered at the same time what answer he would have been able to make had both the girl been present do you imagine i would any right that belonged to me because some one tried to rob me of it she asked looking at him with the air of a young princess never neither i believe will my father when he comes to think it over they were at her gate and it occurred to him for the first time what a figure she had become her handsome head was beautifully set upon a neck of surpassing loveliness and her round bosom gave her a pose at once and commanding he had not dreamed in all his life of offering her a more warm salute than a pressure of the hand but into his brain there came the swift thought that were to be gathered cm both ripe lips never yet touched by lover the half moon poured its light through the trees upon them neither spoke for some moments but she knew that his eyes had seen something never revealed before and her heart gave a throb quite new to its maiden i shall see you to morrow she said breaking the stillness from very necessity yes sometime i have promised to devote a little of each day to reading law so as to put myself ahead when i get to but i will come over afterward they exchanged good nights and he walked the few steps that took him to his door with the strangest feelings he had ever had his head was hot and there was a commotion in all his he only exchanged a word with his father who had sat up to wait for him he wanted to get to bis own room where he could be alone chapter vi why you love them both thought a good deal over the that had made in reference to the claims and convinced himself that she had a good deal of right on her side he was not naturally and would much rather exchange pleasant words with any person than cross ones there were only a dozen parties or so to the suit which had been brought against him and he con the to send some one to them to ascertain what sum would satisfy each in case he should decide to settle the matter it was not wise for him to go because they would then have a chance to quote his offers should fail some must do the work and he naturally thought of one of the lawyers of the village but he knew both of these legal very well and he had not the greatest confidence in them of one he doubted the ability and he had fears of the other s integrity it suddenly occurred to him to ask the young man was in the ways of business to be sure but it was a very simple thing he would have to do a little tact a over of any that had been developed and an appeal to their common sense was all that was needed and could do this as well as an older and more experienced person besides it would be a good thing for him as a to the profession he was about to adopt yes he would offer him the work was a little startled when the proposition was made to him he feared that it was beyond his powers to undertake the reconciliation of elements already so far divided he knew enough of human nature to see that the task was a very different one at the present stage from what it would have been before ill feeling had become so large an he would have to meet men who not only felt themselves entitled to for the actual they had sustained but who had been injured in their pride by words that naturally follow strained relations they had doubtless had together in their state and had ed them both t to do everything in their power to defeat their opponent he said to mr while he was flattered by being selected for this undertaking he feared he could not enter upon it with sufficient confidence he thought some older and more experienced person would be better to engage mr replied that he was willing to run all the risks himself and that he would not hold him at all responsible in the event of failure you can see these men at least said he and report to me the mood they are in it may be that i shall be compelled to go to law after all but before anything more is done in that line i want to give them a chance to get out of it ,5

yes but it is so and we do not to hide our or to as if we were ashamed of it we are two ships each with a coarse and a destination and our ways may draw to again and we may make holiday as before and how peacefully the good ships used to lie in the same harbour under the same sun it seemed as if they had reached their destination and it seemed as if there was a destination but soon the mighty sway of our tasks laid on us as from of old and drove us into different seas and different and it may be that we shall never meet again and it may be that we shall meet and not know each other so deeply have the different seas and changed us the law that is over us that we must become strangers one to the other and for this we must reverence each other the more and for this the memory of our past friendship becomes more sacred perhaps there is a vast invisible curve and and our different and ways are parcel of it let us ourselves to this thought but our life is too short and our sight too feeble for us to be friends except in the sense of this sublime possibility so let us believe in our friendship though we must be enemies on earth a deep and mysterious truth he said and i must i must go â my irish life is ended there is a and ireland and i are parts of it and we must believe in our friendship though we are enemies upon earth he wandered on admiring the large evening and the bright bay great men had risen up in ireland and had failed before him and it were easy to account for their failure by saying they were not dose enough to the tradition of their race that they had just missed it but some of the fault must be the fault of ireland the anecdote but it is always the same story the interests of ireland sacrificed to the interests of rome there came a sound and high overhead he saw three great birds flying through the still air and he knew them to be wild flying south war had broken out in south africa were going out to fight once again they were going to fight the stranger abroad when they could fight him at home no longer the birds died down on the horizon and the sea lay before him bright and beautiful with ships passing into the glowing dusk and among the hills a little mist was gathering he remembered the great who had wandered over these hills before and were invented his thoughts came in flashes and his happiness grew intense he had wanted to go and the birds had shown him where he might go his instinct was to go he was stifling in ireland a mean ineffectual atmosphere he said of and a mist was rising and the lovely outlines of reminded him of pagan ireland they re like music he said and he thought of and his harp will ever come again he said better to die than to live here the mist â he could see no longer the land is he said and as if in answer to his words the most melody he had ever heard came out of the mist the wailing of an abandoned race he said this is the from which we are and he wandered about calling to the shepherd and the shepherd answered but the mist was so thick in the hollows that neither could find the other after a little while the shepherd began to blow his again and ned listened and repeated the melody over and over again to himself as he walked home and the moment he entered the he said to don t speak to me i am going to write something down and this is what he wrote i s i i tr h ii n i r i r j r i r j r n j j m ft i i j l j r a mist came on suddenly and i heard a shepherd playing this folk tune listen to it isn t it like the people isn t it like ireland isn t it like everything that has happened it is melancholy enough in this room but no words can describe its on a played by a shepherd in the mist it is the song of the exile it is the cry of one driven out in the night â into a night of wind and rain it is night and the exile on the edge of the waste it is like the wind sighing over water it is a prophetic echo and final despair of a people who knew they were done for from the beginning a mere folk tune mere nature raw and and these raw folk tunes are all that we shall have done and by these and these alone shall we be remembered ned she said at last i think you had better go away i can see you re wearing out your heart here why do you think i should go what put that idea into your head can see you are not happy but you said that the wheel would turn and that what was lowest would come to the top yes ned but sometimes the wheel is a long time in turning and maybe it would be better for yon to go away for a while perhaps yes for a while it was wild that put the idea of going to africa to fight for the into my head you re going to fight for the ned i am going to africa you said that the wild went to fight the stranger abroad when they could fight him at home no longer you ,3

more black and sullen he spent whole days â indeed it was his sole occupation â in with the serpent a conversation was sustained in which as it seemed the hidden monster bore a part though to the listeners and except in a hiss singular as it may appear the sufferer had now contracted a sort of affection for his mingled however with the and horror nor were such emotions each on the contrary

paying nothing themselves for travel entertainment balls c c this is certainly handsome and i acknowledge the courtesy though i shall not accept the invitation i leave for scotland and ireland on monday m england central and northern tuesday july i came up through the heart of england by railroad yesterday from london by near and through york near to this place where coal is found in abundance as its black of smoke might testify lies lu the head of on the about thirty miles inland from the e n e coast of england three hundred mile from london and is an ancient town mainly built of brick exhibiting considerable and commercial activity the british are better built more substantial and costly than ours but their management does not equal my they make no such time as is reported on our side and are by no means for the single express train daily from london to to make the distance miles in about twelve hours which is less than miles per hour with the best of double tracks through a remarkably level everything put out of its way and no more stops than its own necessities of and water require we should easily beat this in america with anything like equal and without charging the british price â â s or over for a distance not equal to the length of the railroad almost wholly through a and busy region where coal is most abundant and ver at our train the mail started from london at a m and should have been here at p m or in a little less than miles per hour but the running throughout the country is now with excursion and of passengers on low excursion return tickets to see the great exhibition which is quite as it should be but the consequent delay and of the regular trains is as it should not be the companies have no moral right to fish up a quantity of irregular and temporary business to the of their promises and the serious disappointment of their regular customers as things are managed we left london with a train of cars half of them filled with excursion passengers for whom a separate engine should have been but was not provided so that we were behind time from the first and arrived here at this morning instead of last night the spirit of accommodation is not strikingly evinced on british the train at a place to which you are a stranger and you perhaps hear its name called out for the benefit of the passengers who are to stop there but whether the halt is to last half a minute five minutes or ten you must find out as you can the french are better in this respect and the american cannot be worse though the fault is not unknown there a penny programme for each train to be sold at the chief stations on each important route stating not merely at what place but exactly how long each halt of that particular train would be made is one of the yet wants of railroad our path and railway guides undertake to tell so much that plain people ar confused and often by them and are to pick out the little information they actually need from the wilderness of figures and facts set before them let us have guides so simple that no guide is needed to explain them there is much in english rural scenery i have now neat y a â wi t â t i and without seeing anything like a mountain and hardly a precipice except the cliffs of the sea shore nearly every acre i have seen is susceptible of cultivation and of course either cultivated built upon or devoted to wood a few steep banks of streams or almost uniformly wooded aud some small mainly on the sea coast are all the exceptions i remember to the general capacity for cultivation usually the aspect of the country is pleasant â beautiful if you choose â but calculated to excite wonder or enthusiasm the abundance of hedges is its most striking characteristic i judge that of england is in grass meadow or pasture very green and and dotted with noble herds of cattle and flocks of sheep they are anxious to finish hay making throughout the region we traversed yesterday but as there has been scarcely an hour of very sunshine during the last six days more than half of which have been rainy the operation is one rather trying to human patience some of the cut grass looks as if it were spread out to rot and all of it a want of shelter this morning is almost fair though so that the necessity of taking ,8

supply in a suitable solution in some of common salt in some of along with an indifferent of lead or iron the containing cell in many designs supplying the latter the action of the cell depends upon the peculiarity of that as it allows a current to pass freely but as it high resistance this resistance is due doubtless to whereby a thin of is formed on the surface of the metal the other phase or direction of current easily breaks through this but up to a certain the cell allows only that phase to pass by suitable combination of explained later both phases may be and a current obtained an supply of the liquid will interfere with the of a cell if the temperature rises above â f but short of that those may do a lot of heavy work especially if arranged as advised on p and shown in there for x ray work the current produced is not satisfactory either led direct to the or passed through an for charging from an main however these work very satisfactorily in the note on already referred to will be found a description of the arrangement in our hospital work this was the original plan adopted and it served fairly well for about two years until pressure of work induced us to it for the

been previously supplied to them elsewhere in this chapter and we suggest possible arrangements of a nature where the set must be self sources of supply for all purposes with such apparatus for production of energy it will probably be advantageous in many cases to combine the use of these may be charged from the source and kept in readiness for immediate use at any time whereas it may be inconvenient to bring the into action when current is required for bedside work are ordinarily the source of supply worthy of consideration though the advent of a form of machine would alter the definite character of this statement the method of charging for such use will depend upon local conditions of the in the absence of a convenient direct supply for a permanent may be used after being charged elsewhere but if much work is to be done it is better in our opinion to some form of apparatus to provide a direct supply this may be understood when we come to speak of the process of for if a source be inconvenient then the chances are that the will not be so frequently or regularly as they ought to be in order to preserve their under such circumstances also transport of the renders this

the skirts of his coat so as to throw them out like the tail of a cock he erected his figure even beyond the perpendicular line for a time this was a busy and a gay scene by the exhibition of that good and natural freedom from the of forms which one of the most features of a genuine hospitality the tumult gradually subsided as the several personages in the room retreated towards the hall and it was not long before the whole party seemed to be entirely a gathering and had separated into as many fragments as whim or chance produced some sauntered towards the bridge and thence to the stable some sat in the shade of the porch and the topics that interested the country and others wandered as far as the whence might be heard an occasional laugh the sudden consequence of some well told story

imperious calls of appetite was near at hand still mr had not yet appeared divers speculations were set on foot us to the cause of his absence perhaps he had forgotten his engagement but that was not probable considering how careful he was known to be in all such matters and especially after the interest he had expressed to relieve from the sense of mortification which he supposed his friend felt in his defeat he could not have lost his way nor could he have mistaken the hour a general anxiety at length began to prevail on the subject was particularly desirous to meet his neighbor at this

fascinating colonel certainly my dear the carriage is at your disposal but indeed i cannot consent to your your precious health by this foolish project of s i shall therefore write a note immediately after breakfast and despatch it to with your excuses my love replied lady firmly s color rose she continued her coffee but there a calm determination in her eye which did not escape the notice of sir who was sitting beside her has always some ridiculous fancies and schemes poor girl she thinks they make her of importance but it is quite out of the question your thinking of going to day i cannot conceive what novelty you find in these i believe i have ridden with you there some hundred times so my dear do not distress us by talking about it more exclaimed lord looking up from his paper but dearest papa i promised so very faithfully and the weather is clearing and the sun actually struggling down to dry op this we shall have such a delightful ride pray let me go i exclaimed in those tones her indulgent father never resist while lady finding her daughter had f one of her energetic ceased to offer any very opposition come your coffee and will be cold before you have the of that heap of letters i hope yoa ha e good news from court of your pretty ward lady said lord addressing the earl who since the arrival of the post bag in the of the opposite window to that where had stationed herself busily reading his numerous letters sir fancied though to be sure he might be mistaken â that his friend for reasons known only to himself found more interest in watching the actions of the fair young girl before him than in the delicate pages in his hand thank you lady is quite well though she writes in depressed spirits for her friend mrs has been seriously replied lord pushing aside his letters and taking the vacant chair near lady i really must for my lady pray do not think that necessary may i now inquire what this expedition is on which you appear so resolved said lord with a smile rising and bringing his cup to her did not could not speak she silently filled the cup and hastily withdrew her fair hand as it came in contact with that of her there could now no longer be any reasonable doubt as to the intimacy with the mistress of court they i the hand of lady had filled those miniature sheets of paper with lines written closely and finely as with the pen of a fairy who could pretend now to deny their intimacy no not even her friend i v meanwhile the day was clearing the heavy clouds burst and rolled gradually away and the damp gray mist vanished first one little gleam of sunshine rested on the summit of the distant hills then another fell on the dull angry looking water of the lake presently a tiny morsel of the most luminous peeped from beneath the dense leaden expanse above another few minutes and the bright beams struggled and poured downwards and the pale blue sky became by masses which sailed and until they dissolved in the clear as predicted the heavens by noon bade fair to be a perfect blaze of splendor â and she was more resolved than ever on her expedition look look mamma i told you we should still in another lovely day cried she triumphantly trying to lord s question pointing to a brilliant ray which fell that instant on the crimson glass on the breakfast table the day appears to have taken a most unexpected turn mj love but still i believe you will find it very damp and disagreeable amongst the ruins and is so shaded by trees but if you are resolved to go have you requested lord s escort for you cannot ride alone my dear and i fear your father has other engagements this morning said determined upon making another effort lord repeated his question and this time sir answered â the state of the case is this miss fears to be to death in the house doomed to the society of two such very companions as you and i and therefore in spite of the elements on joining a party to abbey planned by that veiy young lady miss now you are quite au in the matter although i think it very unreasonable of you not to yield to your mother s wishes and the ride until a more day yet if you have any especial motive for joining miss s party i shall have great pleasure in accompanying you said lord gently fixing his earnest eyes oh face blushed and turned away with an sensation at her heart especial motive had she not only one little week to decide on the most momentous event of her life i and three days were already expired ah â i why were you like those foolish ones who blindly reject the good the happiness god invariably places sometime in his children s path in search of that vague imagination always pictures though never s principles however were too upright too honorable to her to accept the offer of the earl s escort knowing what ber secret object in the expedition was but this again involved her in fresh perplexity i fear the morning is rather damp and unpleasant for those who have lately been accustomed to a more genial climate therefore should be so very sorry to force you to this gallop over our bleak hills said she hesitatingly â i dare say is going â though are you quite sure ,7

audience and bright with gold and color on the stage a young woman in a garment which should have been high where it was low and vice was singing a ballad the words of which did not reach s ear whereby to judge from the that followed â verse she must have lost a great artistic treat it was not from disappointment however that groaned and clasped her hands like one in pain her wrinkled face had shuddering fear in it and in her bright eyes might have been read a sort of terror fortunately the attention of the company was too much engrossed for them to notice her and presently her guide lifted a curtain which opened on a passage at the end of which was a door with a ground glass pane on which was inscribed manager s boom had recovered the slip of paper whereon her address was written and which perhaps would have availed her but little mr might have been led to admit her to his presence from the fact of her being under the same roof as v but that might also have affected him the other way his views had already met with opposition from her indeed she had spoken very plainly to him on the only occasion that he had paid a visit to ford s alley she had told him that no effort of hers should be wanting to persuade to reject his proposition that she should sing at the shades and bad even expressed a decided and opinion upon the character of that establishment upon the whole it was well for her scheme perhaps that the in blue satin had taken her part and got the gate of this earthly paradise open for her her guide took no more upon him than to point to the manager s door and then left her to introduce which were his orders in such cases mr s visitors upon business being sometimes unwilling to have their names to more persons than necessary knocked boldly and in answer to

little swords and wreaths and flags and on the floor were various other articles of appearance but as even could understand of slight worth the owner of these properties was himself in a costume that belonged at least in part to the stage he wore tight fitting black in silk stockings and shoes while a gorgeous dressing gown concealed the rest of his ample proportions an active figure was mr s still notwithstanding his tendency to deposit or as the vulgar call it fat and considering that he was also at least fifty years of age his face was lined rather than wrinkled he had a close head and that blue black look of the cheeks peculiar to actors off the stage but he would have been well looking enough had it not been for the somewhat cynical expression and want of vivacity in his keen gray eyes well madam â your business i need not ask who you are said he this allusion to the poor woman s personal appearance which once seen was not indeed likely to be forgotten would have been in a but then no had had mr s experience he honestly believed that s objections to her niece s joining his company were and that she had now come to him to drive a bargain my business is my niece you have had a letter from her i believe of course i have why not say you know it at once and the contents of it i do not know the contents of it but i guess that she has agreed to sing on your stage for money she does not propose to do so for love if you mean that i am sure i am telling you no secret when i say she wants three pounds a week did you ever hear of such three pounds a week for a whose voice has never been tried except in a church choir perhaps however he added with a sneer you are come here to propose some in the terms i think the terms are high said gravely you would never give that money

little cabin in and for convenience in getting water and for the sake of music and society i led a small stream from creek into it running along the side of the wall it was not in the way and it had just fall to ripple and sing in low tones m g delightful company especially at night when i was lying awake then a few came in and made merry with the stream â and one snake i suppose to catch the returning from my long walks i usually brought home a large handful of plants partly for study for ornament and set them in a corner of the cabin with their stems in the stream to keep them fresh one day when i picked up a handful that had begun to fade i uncovered a large that had been hiding behind the flowers thus suddenly brought to light face to face with the owner of the place the poor was desperately embarrassed evidently that he national had no right in the cabin it was not only feat that he showed but a good deal of illness and embarrassment like that of r more than half honest person caught under circumstances behind a door instead of striking or threatening to strike though and ready he slowly drew his head down as far as he could with awkward confused in his neck and a expression as if wishing the ground would open and hide him i have looked into the eyes of so many wild animals that i feel sure i did not mistake the feelings of this unfortunate snake i did not want to kill him but i had many visitors some of them children and i came in late at night so i judged he must die since then i have seen perhaps a hundred or more in these mountains but i have never disturbed them nor have they me to any great extent even by though in danger of being stepped on while i was on my knees a fire one glided under the arch made by my arm he was only going away from the ground i had selected for a camp and there was not the slightest danger because i kept still and allowed him to go in peace the only time i felt myself in serious danger was when i was coming out oâ the by a steep side toward the head of creek on an among the animals of the earthquake a in my way presented a front so high that i could just reach the upper edge of it while standing on the next below it drawing myself up as soon as my head was above the flat top of it i caught sight of a my hands had alarmed him and he was ready for me but even with this provocation and when my head came in sight within a foot of him he did not strike the last time i sauntered through the big i saw about two a day one was not but neatly folded in a narrow space between two on the side of the river his head below the level of them ready to shoot up like a the box for or birds my foot the space above within an inch or two of his head but he only held it lower in making my way through a particularly tedious of i parted the branches on the side of an open spot and threw my bundle of bread into it and when with my arms free i was pushing through after it i saw a small dragging his tail from beneath my bundle when he caught sight of me he eyed me angrily and with an air of righteous indignation seemed to be asking why i had thrown that stuff on him he was so small that i was inclined to slight him but he struck out so angrily that i drew back and approached the opening from the other but he had been listening and national when i looked the brush i found him me still with a in if you dare expression in vain i tried to that i only wanted my bread he stoutly held the in front of it so i went back a dozen rods and kept still for half an hour and when i returned he had gone one evening near in a very rough portion of the i searched long for a level spot for a bed and at last was glad to find a patch of flood sand on the and a lot of dose by for a but wh i i threw down my bundle i two in possession of the g und i might have passed the night even in this snake den without danger for i never knew a single instance of their coming into camp in the night but fearing that in so small a space some late comers not aware of my presence might get stepped on when i was the fire to avoid possible crowding i on one of the earthquake there are two species of in the park and when i was exploring the basin of greek i thought i had discovered a new one i saw a snake with curious divided on its head going nearer i found that the strange was only the feet of a cutting a i struck the snake lightly until he the poor or rather allowed it to among the animals of the u back out on its return to the light from one of the very darkest of death valleys it a moment with a sort of dazed look then plunged into a stream apparently happy and well abound in all the pools and lakes however cold and high and isolated how did they manage to get up these high mountains surely not by jumping long and dry excursions through weary miles of and brush ,13

nothing whatever what mr sustained in the way of mental pain during that week the reader can only imagine his love for margaret rivers had grown with every hour since she left him his apprehensions for her safety doubled as time passed he even feared that in desperation she had committed suicide and among the he made was a careful inspection of the self destroyed in a dozen cities from lists sent to the by request when he returned to boston his belief that he would never see margaret again was he was actually giving up all hope life would be to him a dreary existence by love of woman a mere round of business cares of plain duties the other thing that troubled him now was the inevitable conflict with his father he had seen this parent hovering on the edge of the grave too recently not to dread the encounter but come it must there was no escape had had no private conversation with the their marriage bond u since he announced his intention of breaking the engagement but on the day of his return from new york mrs sent him a note asking for an interview it served at least as an escape from his father s tongue and when the evening arrived presented himself at the widow s residence was not present for which he was thankful during two hours he was subjected to mrs s ingenious arguments delivered with all her art and in her most agreeable manner she presented the case in a dozen lights in every one of which he seemed a wretch unfit for decent society if he carried out his scheme still he was not moved he replied to everything that he had made up his mind that he could not bring himself to the marriage he was very sorry for he would give anything if he could her pain but marry he would not there was nothing for mrs to do after this but to call on mr and him with the situation the anger of the father when he learned what she had to say knew no bounds when his son came home that night he turned upon him savagely and in a torrent of rage demanded his reasons for this conduct seemed by what he had endured and did not mind as much as he once would have done the that were into his ears he replied over and over that he did not love and that nothing would persuade him to wed her seeing that the mode of attack he was using had no effect edward s tone changed suddenly to a pleading one he said he had a terrible secret to reveal to his son one that made this marriage an absolute necessity for years he explained seeing the astonished look in his son s eyes i have been in financial their marriage difficulties i have prevented the truth being known but if my real condition was public to day i should be in the court miss is rich with an alliance between our families everything would be easy you are my only child is the sole heir of her father it would kill me to have my affairs dragged into the newspapers to refuse this marriage would therefore not merely destroy the happiness of a beautiful girl who has trusted you but would end the life of one who has no other hope to preserve a hitherto honored name the young man was astounded he had imagined while giving no special thought to the matter that his father was comfortably off in this world s goods certainly far beyond the line of poverty they had always lived well a snug sum had been paid into the concern to secure the when he mentioned these things he was told that the money put into the firm was borrowed on heavy interest and with this marriage in view as the only way in which the notes could be taken up it was not a very honorable transaction and he felt it to the quick but he could not reproach a father for what he had done however ill for his benefit he began to grow desperate one by one all the that had sustained his life had fallen away his determination not to marry grew weaker even before he was aware of the change ,5
he had once called on to ask if he had read the book of his opera he d just gone into an adjoining room to fetch a clothes brush â he had taken off his coat to brush it â but the moment he saw me he whipped out his handkerchief and said that he must go to the and when i asked him to engage to sing and give her eighty pounds a week if she wouldn t sing it for less he whipped out his handkerchief as you say and asked me if i knew a the idea of without cuts always brings on a violent attack and so well the expression of agony that had come into the manager s face that exploded with laughter she begged to i sha n t be able to sing at all but i have not told you of my make up i don t look at all pretty the ugly curls i wear come from an old german prints and the staid modest gown but it is very provoking i was singing well till that began to argue don t make me laugh again he became very grave i can only think of the joy you gave me his praise brightened her face and she listened i cannot tell you now what i feel perhaps i shall never find words to express what i feel about your i shall be writing about it next week and shall have to try do tell me now you liked it better than my margaret shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and they looked in each other s eyes and could hardly speak so extraordinary was their recognition of each it was intense that they hardly help laughing so strange it seemed that thej should never have met before or should have been separated for such a long time it really seemed to them as if they had known each other from all eternity how can you act she is so different from what you are is she her pale blue eyes seemed to open a little wider and she looked at him he could not keep back the words that rose to his tongue you mean that your dead life now lives in elizabeth yes i suppose that that is it they asked each other whether any part of one s nature is ever really dead a few moments after the were heard singing and m would have to go on the stage she pressed her hands against her forehead herself by an effort of will of her present individuality the chant of the grew louder the procession approached and as it passed across the stage elizabeth sought for but he was not among them so her last earthly hope has perished and she throws herself on her knees at the foot of the cross and it was the sh of her soul that called forth that high note a g repeated three times and it seemed to that she seemed to throw herself upon that note that note as if she would reach god s ears with it and force him to listen to her in the religious almost strain her voice was pure as a little child but when she spoke of her and the music grew more her voice filled with colour â her sex appeared in it and when the music returned to the peace of the religious strain her voice grew and faded like a s voice henceforth her life will be lived beyond this world and as she walked up the stage the and seemed to lead her straight to god thej seemed to a narrow shining path shining and ascending it disappeared amid the light of the stars well she said did i sing it to your satisfaction you re an astonishing no that s just what i am not i go on the stage and act i couldn t tell jou how i do it i am conscious of no rule and the music the music the same i have often been told that i might act shakespeare but without music i could not express myself words without music would seem barren i never try to sing i try to express myself but you ll see my father won t think much of my singing hell compare me to mother and always to my disadvantage i cannot phrase like her but you can your is perfection it is the very emotion father won t think so if he only thought well of my singing he would forgive me how unaffected you are in hearing you speak one hears your very soul do you but tell me is he very shall i meet a face of stone he is no doubt but he must forgive you but every day s delay will make it more difficult i know i know you cannot go to morrow why not to morrow you sing this opera go on saturday you ll be sure to find him on saturday afternoon he has a in the morning and will be at home about four in the afternoon as they walked through the scenery she said as they drove off to see the he asked her if she had seen dean to her great annoyance she said she had not and this falsehood spoilt her afternoon for her she not discover why she had told this lie the memory in her and continued to take her unaware she was tempted to confess the truth to the very words she thought she should use rose up in her mind several times i told you a lie i don t know why i did for there was absolutely no reason why i should have said that i had not seen dean on saturday the annoyance which this lie had caused in her was as keen as ever and it was not until she had got into ,3

shell fish in tolerable abundance but this of the shore was now becoming extremely irksome to those who had any feeling by the bodies of our drowned people thrown among the rocks some of which were hideous spectacles from the condition they were in by the violent surf that drove in upon the coast these horrors were overcome by the of our people who were even glad of the occasion of killing the the crow of that country while on these in order to make a meal of them but a provision by no means to the number of the mouths to be fed could by our utmost industry be acquired from that part of the

upon the talents of a conqueror it is for military men to read this new account and inquire whether did actually commit a decisive fault in remaining idle upon the field of battle of during the morning of the th or whether he was only conquered by the greatness of bis own genius because he attributed to his plans too vast and too bold and daring the measure of the talents of napoleon whether more or less extensive the perfection of his d for war whether more or less admirable is a question of no importance he never took a false step nor committed an error in which was in itself less to be regretted the work of count is distinguished by a tone of frankness and elevation plain truth without severity which is yet careful of the glory of the celebrated chief whose reproaches he is obliged to and whom he charges with errors this work first published in america is preceded in the french edition by a note from count s son equally distinguished by his noble character and filial piety as by his talents col solely occupied for three years by the hope of restoring his father to the country which he has so long served with honor appears to have yielded only to an imperious sense of duty in the memory of an epoch so fatal to his family he is honored by the of an august prince who will render doubly worthy of historic record the noble courage he displayed in the crisis of the th march by

their former literary pursuits which it would seem ought to excuse them for faults committed in a storm more than one general has been restored to his country we earnestly desire that it may be even so with general but does a poet and a literary man appear more dangerous or less worthy of interest an attachment to the throne a distinguished zeal in its cause is perfectly in accordance with the desire to see an end to all unnecessary it is no to a party to deprive them of all cause of complaint it is precisely because the differences of opinion are clearly exposed because the friendly to

constant no event has ever taken place productive of more important results than the disaster of the political consequences of this battle have been such to france and to all europe that it has become one of the most remarkable in after the ruin of this dreadful day when the french arm lost every thing but its honor each one to be from the responsibility napoleon himself who at the same time lost both his sword an s his his companions in arms is desirous to attribute his misfortune to secondary causes it is at least in this spirit that the work of general is and all the accounts published have more or less of it they have endeavoured to cast the entire blame upon napoleon s two and this by arguments the more unsatisfactory both in matter and manner as they are by any official documents and from plans of the campaign made after the events had the first thing which strikes us is that few of the writers have remarked the enormous between the french army and that of the the one containing scarce men while and commanded strong ought not such a superiority to have great weight in settling the accounts of this campaign count after four years of exile and silent resignation has just published his observations upon the work of general the only one which he admits has any he at the same time the of the other writers attacked and under circumstances the severity with which he

in his here is also a certain custom observed time out of mind of planting rose upon the graves especially by the young men and maids who have lost their loves so that this churchyard is now full of

elegance of thought which pervaded the whole of these funeral thus it was an especial precaution that none but sweet scented and flowers should be employed the intention seems to have been to soften the horrors of the tomb to the mind from brooding over the of and to associate the memory of the deceased with the most delicate and beautiful objects in nature there is a dismal process going on in the grave ere dust can return to its kindred dust which the imagination from contemplating and we seek still to think of the form we have loved with those refined associations which it awakened when

touching has disappeared from general use and exists only in the most remote and insignificant villages but it seems as if poetical custom always the walks of cultivated society in proportion as people grow polite they cease to be poetical they talk of poetry but they have learnt to check its free impulses to distrust its emotions and to supply its most affecting and rural by studied form and

telling of these rocks to the hasty are those that make up the mass of mountain on its north side it presents a section two thousand feet high of roughly beds of sand ashes and coarse and fine forming the edges of a wonderful set of volumes lying on their sides â books a million years old well bound miles in size with full page illustrations on the of this one section we see trunks and of fifteen or twenty ancient forests ranged one above another standing where they g w or prostrate and broken like the of ruined temples in desert sands â a forest fifteen or twenty stories high the roots of

like hail and our national snow through the leaves and branches choking the streams covering the ground crushing bushes and rapidly deepening packing around the trees and breaking them rising higher until the boughs of the giants were buried leaving not a leaf or in sight so complete was the desolation at last the storm began to the fiery soil settled mud floods and floods passed over it it it rains fell and mellow sunshine and it became fertile and ready for another crop birds and the winds and brought seeds from more f woods and a new forest grew up on the top of the buried one centuries

all sorts of schemes used to present themselves to me to my pocket one was to go out as a on the streets clean bricks or do anything i was not lazy i would have walked around the world for a case i do not think i was ashamed of it for i knew it was respectable but i was afraid some one i knew might pass by i was afraid that or mrs might see me and â yes that that young girl from the house might recognize me i had often thought of her since i had dropped them into my pocket book and now when this idea came to me i took them out and looked at them they still retained a faint fragrance what would be the result if she should pass by and see me cleaning bricks â me a and â the thoughts came together â should see me i would win on my own line if it took me all my life the idea of suggested another plan why not gambling was gentlemanly â at least gentlemen but did they play for a living i had a little myself in the past played and like most men myself on my game though i generally lost in the long run and when i was making good resolutions after my failure i had made up my by john marvel assistant mind never to play again anywhere and i had always held to the opinion that as soon as a man played for his living he crossed the line and ceased to be a gentleman now however it began to appear to me as if this were the only plan by which could make anything and as if i should have a good excuse for breaking my resolution i resisted the temptation for some time but one night when i had nearly everything and had only three or four dollars left i went out and after a long but half hearted battle gave up as such are always lost and turned into a street across an alley from my office where i knew there was a gambling place over a saloon kept by one i went boldly up the stairs even as i mounted them i felt a sort of i stopped at the door and my old resolution not to play again stirred and struggled a little i caught it however with a sort of grip almost physical and gave it a shake till it was quiet i knew i should win the blaze of light within cheered me and without hesitating an instant i walked across the room to where a crowd stood watching the play of some one seated at a table it was a large and richly decorated room with a few rather daring pictures on the walls and much about the ceiling the hot air heavy with tobacco smoke and of one kind and another met me in a blast as i entered and involuntarily i thought of a sweat shop i had once seen in my earlier days but the sensation passed and left me warm and as i passed along a man looked at me and half nodded i knew he was the proprietor i made my way in and by the gulf caught the dealer s eye and taking out a note as carelessly as if my pockets were stuffed with them i glanced over the board to select my bet at one end of the table sat the large heavy man i had run into one night on the leading from the alley to the building where i had my office he was somewhat and evidently in bad luck for he was heated and was wildly near by sat a big sour looking fellow dressed whom i recognized as having been one of my fellow travellers on the side train the one who had talked to the of their wrongs he still wore his diamonds his silk hat and patent leather shoes but i took little notice of these casually as i dropped my note my eye fell on the player at the middle of the table he was surrounded by of as i looked he in a new pile at least a hundred dollars and he never changed a he was calmer than the dealer before him he was in evening dress and success had given him quite an air i caught up my note without knowing it and fell back behind a group of young men who had just come up curious things happen sometimes i found my note doubled up in my hand when i had got out of doors a quarter of an hour later all i remember is my at seeing that sitting there in money so calmly with my money for his stake in his pocket and i turned out for him an adventurer who said all american women were at his bidding it recalled to me the girl i had seen on the train and had handed later by john marvel assistant into her and the good resolutions i had formed and it strung me up like wine i felt that i was a coward to have come there and as bad as just as i to leave the place a party of young fellows entered the room they had come from a dinner at mr s as i understood from their talk j and were on to a dance unless the luck should run to suit them they were in high spirits mr s champagne having done its work and they were evidently of the place and good j i judged from the respect paid them by the attendants the leader of them was a large rather good looking young fellow but with marks of on a face without a line of refinement in it the others all seemed to be his followers they greeted familiarly and by name ,1
is what we who are married â at all events if married by the ministers of any christian â uniformly to do i distinctly remember that my marriage was for better for worse and until death do part i presume yours was the same iii that of in opposition to the ideas and current in his time alike among jews and expressly declared to be the only reason for a marriage iv that the nature and inherent of marriage demand that it be except for that one crime which its essential condition in other words no marriage can be innocently dissolved but the husband or wife may be released from the engagement upon proof of the utter and of its essential condition by the other party and now allow me to say that i do not see that your second letter successfully any of these positions you do not and cannot deny that our standard define marriage as i do and deny the name to any temporary arrangement you do not deny that i have truly stated christ s doctrine on the subject whereof the christian of marriage whether in the catholic or churches is a standing evidence and i am willing to let your criticism on christ s statement pass without comment so with r ard to moses i am content to leave moses s law of divorce to the brief but of and his unquestionably correct that from the beginning it was not so but you say that if my position is sound i make a sweeping assertion against the of the marriages now existing in and other states o no sir i nine of the people in those states â i trust â were married by christian ministers under the law of christ they solemnly to remain faithful until death and they are that promise marriage and divorce tour easy divorce laws are nothing to them their conscience and lives have no part in those laws your state might decree that any couple may divorce themselves at pleasure and still those who regard as their divine master and teacher would hold fast to his word and live according to a higher law than that and relaxed by you i entirely from your that the words of relative to e and divorce may have been intended to have a local and temporary application on the contrary i believe he unlike moses the eternal and universal law founded not in accommodation to special but in the essential nature of god and man i admit that he may sometimes have withheld the truth that he deemed his unable to comprehend and accept but i insist that what he did set forth was the absolute fact but i did not him to reason by authority but because you referred first to christianity and the will of god and because i believe what he said respecting marriage to be the very truth can you seriously imagine that your personal on his words should the uniform tradition and practice of all you understand i presume that i hold to from bed and board â as the laws of this state allow them â only in cases where the party thus separated is in danger of bodily harm from the ferocity of an insane or otherwise husband or wife i do not admit that even such peril can i lease one from the vow of which is the vital condition of marriage it may possibly be that there is temptation involved in the position of one thus separated but i judge this evil far less than that which must result from the easy dissolution of marriage for here is the vital truth that your theory the divine end of marriage is or the and increase of the human to this end it is indispensable â at least eminently desirable â that each child should enjoy protection at the hands of a mother s not only but of a father also in other words the parents should be so attached so devoted to each other that hey shall be practically but by death creatures of appetite fools of temptation lovers of change as men are there is but one potent to distinguish between genuine affection and its and that is the solemn searching question do you know this woman so thoroughly and love her so profoundly that you can assuredly promise that you will all others and to her only until death if you can your union is one that god has and man may honor and approve but if not wait till you can thus pledge yourself to some one heaven and earth to witness your truth if you rush into a with one whom you do not thus know and love and who does not thus know and love you yours is the crime the shame yours be the life long penalty i do not think as men and women actually are this law can be improved when we reach the spirit world i presume we shall find a divine law adapted to its and to our moral condition here i am satisfied with that set forth by christ and while i admit that individual cases of hardship arise under this law i hold that there is seldom an unhappy marriage that was not an unworthy one â hasty and heedless if not positively vicious and if people god can scarcely save them from consequent suffering and i do not think you or i can new march a to the of thb n y â sir your paper of yesterday th contains a letter bearing the of after from the of march marriage and divorce the doctrine of the new testament which is carried out in the law of the state of new york and which only divorce in case of the writer falls foul of that people the jews and their moses whose law of

another i suppose we ve been very good friends and i don t want to remember any of this when i am on the sea and beyond it in some inexplicable way they were in each other s arms he had forgotten for

sudden joy held me like this r if it was a minute it was a very long one the longest perhaps that old time has ever had to record for the morning sun came and found them there in that room where they had the one kiss the wife had had not been finished yet thus love in spite of all his enemies forever finds a way when we think him conquered and his army put to he his through the walls and his banner on the no general yet born could successfully combat him and when the victor has the that his progress how he the planting flowers and shade trees where the noisy cannon stood how he brings the little children at their games over the fields of strife every grave with love gone astray chapter xix i the wheat pit during the week before he reached new york gray was in a he walked the deck of his steamer mechanically ate his meals with only the slightest attention to his neighbors at table and lay awake far into the night thinking of his parting hours with how had the sudden change come to pass how had their relations altered in the twinkling of an eye from those of ordinary friendship mingled with a certain element of distrust to the warmest and most that can exist between a man and a woman he was in a whirl of doubt as to whether he ought to be proud of what had occurred or very much ashamed the unusual manner in which his marriage had taken place the reasons that had naturally made him reserved in his wife s presence the acceptance on the part of both of them of the situation as it seemed to outline itself all came back to him then there was the tumultuous rush of blood to his head the clasping of that warm and yielding figure to his heart the forgetting of everything as he lay in his berth night after night he had but one wild overpowering wish that and not uninteresting masculine passengers occupied the cabin with him he wanted her that woman he had rejected so long with a severity he could not now thk wheat pit whatever she had been whatever might be between them in the past he wanted her now it was not reason it was the mad impulse of youth she was his wife but that was not it she might have been any other woman under the sun and it would hate been the same he wanted her upon landing he received several from colonel and one from the first were of the utmost importance to the business he had crossed the ocean to accomplish the latter was brief and contained only these words come back as soon as you can to the woman you have made the happiest on earth it was only with the greatest effort that he could turn from this message which he a hundred times and fix his mind on the others he sent an answer not happier darling than you have made me and then devoted himself as well as he could to the duties before him there had been a terrible time on the board at in a week fortunes are made and lost in speculation the entire amount that colonel had at stake trembled in the balance tied to the bedside of his suffering wife he could only depend on this the final merely told mr gray to use his judgment whatever that might be he felt as his mind grew stronger that he must accomplish something to justify the kindness and confidence in him by this man who had acted toward him like a second and most indulgent father love gone astray but there are places where the human mind finds itself overpowered by circumstances the that had taken place in the market could only be compared to an in its sweeping force strong hands were in the deal to lower prices and the effort had succeeded to a startling degree when gray arrived at colonel s were at their wits end to keep him from being called on the floor of the exchange brought little to change the situation he had authority to borrow money if necessary but at a time when everybody knew the business of everybody else that was not easy to get for a man who held the wrong side of the a little was obtained in one place and a little in another but it only matters a trifle and the downward tendency continued to make all efforts seem useless when some days had passed and he had exhausted all his funds gray heard of a new firm of who were taking risks for those ready to pay exceptional figures in despair of finding what he wanted elsewhere he decided to pay the interest they were said to demand if he could get them to loan enough on the security he could give he was

takes one to dress sometimes all one s things get wrong and when the skirt she suddenly remembered she had no suitable to the gown it was sunday it would be impossible to buy one there was nothing for it but to send for if there was anything wrong with her gown he would give her no peace he wished her to wear a flower embroidered dress but her fancy was set on a pale yellow muslin and it amused her to get cross with him and to send him out of the room but when the door closed she was moved to run after him the grave question as to what she would wear other thoughts she must be serious and to please him she decided she would wear the gown he liked and as she fixed the hat that went with it she admired the contrast of its purple with her rich hair was always right she had never thought that she could look so well and it was a moment when he took her by both hands and said â dearest yon are delicious â quite delicious you ll be the prettiest woman at to day she asked for tea but he said they were in france and must to french taste when was informed that the people wanted bread etc thought must have been a cruel woman but she liked and the and henceforth they were brought to her bedside and in a service a present from when they had finished the little meal he rang for writing material and said â now my dear you must write to your father i what shall i say oh i cannot write if i did father would come over here and then i ll tell you what to say i ll dictate the letter you ought to write you need not give him any address but you must let him know you re well and why you intend to remain abroad it is by his mind on these subjects that you ll save yourself from the vexation of his hunting you up here come now he said noticing the and bewildered look on s face this is the only disagreeable hour in the day â you must put up with it here is the pen now write â my dear father â i should be happy in paris very happy if it were not for the knowledge of the that my flight must have occasioned you of course i have acted very very â but said you told me i was acting rightly that to do otherwise would be madness ye and i only told you the truth but in writing to your father you must adopt the conventional tone there s no use in trying to persuade your father you did right i don t know though scratch out i have acted and very and write â â t will not ask you to think that i have acted otherwise than for of course as a father you can hold no other opinion but being also a clever man an artist you will perhaps be inclined to admit that my wrong doing is not so a wrong doing as it might have been in other and easily imagined circumstances full stop ti you ve got that â so a wrong doing as it might have been in other and easily imagined circumstances yes father dear you know that if i had remained in my voice would have been wasted not through my fault or yours but through the fault of circumstances you have got circumstances a few lines higher up so put through the fault of fate father will never believe that i wrote this letter that doesn t matter â the truth is the truth from whoever it comes we should have gone on deceiving ourselves or trying to deceive ourselves hoping as soon as the paid that i should go abroad with a proper you know father dear how we used to talk both knowing well that no such thing could be the years would have slipped by and at five and thirty when it would have been too late i should have found exactly where i was when mother died yon have reproached yourself you would have suffered remorse we should have both been miserable whereas now i hope that we shall both be happy you will bring about a revival of and i shall sing opera be reasonable father and remember that it had to be write to me if you can to hear from you will make me very happy but do not try to seek me out and endeavour to induce me to return home any meeting between us now would merely mean intolerable suffering to both of us and it would serve no purpose whatever a little later when i have succeeded when i am a great singer i will come and see you that is to say if you will see me meanwhile for a year or two we had better not meet but i ll write constantly and shall look forward to your letters again my dear father i you to be reasonable everything will come right in the end i will not conceal from you the fact that sir advised me to this step he is very fond of me and is determined to help me in every way when he brings me back to england a great singer he hopes you will try to look on his fault with as much as may be he asks me to warn you against speaking of him in connection with me for any accusation brought against him will injure me he to provide me with a proper i need not mention her name suffice it to say that she is a very grand lady so appearances will be preserved no one need know anything for certain if you do ,3
meeting between and was most interesting to the one who had been the means of bringing them together the girl put out her hand with a straightforward motion of welcome and it was accepted with something resembling timidity by the young man who did not even raise his eyes to hers the talk that followed was nearly all her own s part in it being largely replies to her statements and suggestions when miss was presented to both the gentlemen for the first time mr she very well she drew their attention for a few moments from her sister but soon into the more insignificant place which she seemed to prefer she was not as large in any way as and did not seem likely to become so her hair was of a soft shade of light brown and her eyes a decided blue in the presence of her sister she did not expect to shine and was evidently relieved when she could go into a corner and talk over times long past with mr came in rather late but still before the hour announced for dinner he had his habitual look of quiet elegance but withal an expression of care about his face that attributed to the business troubles of which had spoken the manner of the daughters toward him was marked by the watchful eyes of the chief looked up and said papa this it mr rom a black leaf of whom we have spoken and then when the greetings that followed were exchanged went on talking with those about her as if there had been no interruption on the other hand crept softly to her father s side and putting an arm around his neck kissed him when she thought no one observed her you arc tired papa she whispered no no he said brightening i am very well it was at the table that mr had his first conversation with and the two men got along nicely together himself who saw everything noticed that the negro in the service in the dining room lingered more about miss s chair than any other and took extra pains to see that her wants were anticipated in spite of this however mr frequently asked his younger daughter to have more of certain dishes as if his mind was constantly turned in that direction how long do you think it will require to do the work you have so generously undertaken asked mr of when the was reached it is impossible to say stammered the young man some weeks at least so i supposed said mr that being the case i wish to tender you the hospitality of my home it would be a great deal of trouble for you to come every day from the city and i know we could make you comfortable here a dinner at was about to decline the offer with thanks when mr spoke to him in a low tone take it by all means he said it s a chance in a lifetime you know nothing of family life don t dream of refusing the delay allowed miss to add her request to that of her father and fearing to let his answer mr boldly spoke for him it is a good idea he said he will have his baggage brought up to morrow there s nothing like being on the ground when there s work to be done and with the general permission i am going to run out pretty often myself to see how things progress the bright off hand way of the last speaker seemed to please mr for he heartily this suggestion when the table was mr asked if he might be excused for a few minutes while he wrote a couple of important letters and requested to show the guests through the grounds where they could smoke their cigars till he returned accordingly and accompanied their new guide out of doors and across an extensive lawn to an at the further end where a handsome prospect of the unfolded itself as was wishing for some way of getting rid of temporarily that gentleman an acquaintance in the adjacent road and went off to speak to him are you in love yet you dog asked as soon as he and his young friend were alone what a black you re not don t let an hour pass then you are the best of all is never put off till to morrow what you can do to day m how can i do this to day was the response how you help it you mean there she was at the table hair grey eyes lovely waist everything love could fall in love with that girl marry her get a divorce and commit suicide within forty eight hours even had to smile at this extravagant statement do you want me to do all of those things he asked only the first one at present if you can t do that give up all ideas of being a and secure a place in some factory or counting room everything is ready for you you are here nothing can come in your way oh don t me said he would do his best and the next day he came to prepared to spend a month or longer chapter viii holding her hand for the first three days gave most of his time to reading the that miss had written he could not say that he liked it exactly but that was not necessary to fill in the time he consented to let the girl read his own story that had rejected though he did this with having a dread that she would think it when she had finished it however her delight was unbounded it is lovely she exclaimed in response to his inquiring eyes i cannot see why they refused it i haven t been so interested in a story in years ,5

o clock when bud came up behind the doctor and fastened his eyes on the witness with the same significant look and walter with visions of the before him halted stammered and seemed about to faint again if the court please said this witness is evidently by that stout young man pointing to bud i have seen him twice interrupt witness s testimony by casting threatening looks at him i trust the court will have him removed from the court room the ii after q few moments consultation during which squire held his wig in place with one hand and alternately adjusted his eye and his spectacles with the other the who were utterly bewildered by the turn things were taking decided that it could do no harm and that it was best to try the experiment of removing bud perhaps johnson would then be able to get through with his testimony the therefore asked bud if he would please leave the room bud cast one look at the witness and walked out like a captive bear stood watching the receding form of bud the emergency made him as cool as small ever was bud stopped at the door where he was completely out of sight of the witness concealed by the excited spectators who stood on the benches to see what was going on in front the witness will please proceed said if the court please â it was who spoke â i believe i have as much at stake in this trial as any one that witness is evidently but not by mr means i ask that dr small be removed out of sight of the witness a most extraordinary request truly this was what small s bland countenance said he did not open his lips it s no more than fair said squire his wig that the witness be relieved of everything that anybody might think affects his in this matter dr small giving walter one friendly appealing look moved back by the door and stood alongside bud as meek quiet and disinterested as any man in the house the witness will now proceed with his testimony this time it was squire who spoke had been attacked the trial concluded with a suspicion that this witness was not just what he wanted and had into silence walter s struggle was by no means ended by the disappearance of small and bud there came the recollection of his mother s stem face â a face which had never been a motive toward the right but only a to deception what would she say if he should confess just as he had recovered himself and was about to repeat the old lie which had twice died upon his lips at the sight of bud s look he caught sight of another face which made him tremble again it was the lofty and terrible countenance of mr one might have thought from the expression it wore that the seven last were in his hands the seven trumpets waiting for his lips and the seven sitting upon his eyebrows the moment that walter saw him he the on his own garments he felt himself upon the crumbling brink of the precipice with below him now i am sure that brother were not made wholly in vain there are plenty of mean spirited men like walter johnson whose feeble need all the support they can get from the fear of and who are incapable of any other conception of it than a coarse and one let us set it down to the credit of brother with his stiff stock his face and his awful walk that his influence over walter was on the side of truth please proceed said squire to walter the squire s wig lay on one side he had forgotten to his eye and he leaned foi ward tremulous with interest well then said walter looking not at the court nor at nor at the prisoner but at mr â well then if i must â and mr s awful face seemed the school to answer that he surely must â well then i hope you won t send me to prison â this to squire whose face re assured him â but â oh i don t see how i can but one look at mr assured him that he could and that he must i and so with an agony painful to the spectators he told the story in how while yet in he had been made a member of a gang of which small was chief how they concealed from him the names of all the band except six of whom the and small were three here there was a at the door the court demanded silence dr trying to out plague take him said bud who stood with his back planted against the door i d like the court to send and his trunk afore he has a chance to bum up all the papers that s in it you will arrest dr small peter jones and william jones send two to bring small s trunk into court said squire the attorney was silent walter then told of the robbery at told where he and small had the fence while the entered the house and confirmed s story by telling how they had seen in a fence comer and how they had met the basket maker on the hill to be sure said the old man who had not ventured to hold up his head after he was arrested until walter began his testimony walter felt inclined to stop but he could not do it for there stood mr looking to him like a messenger from the skies or the pit sent to the last word from his guilty the trial concluded soul he felt that he was making a clean breast

meant to avoid he answered quite naturally yes â i m beginning to see my way now and it s wonderful how they respond â and they walked on without a shadow of between them while he described to her

paper with such other information as could be obtained from other sources as we visited all parts of the basin lying to the south of the solid and between on the east and south straits and part of the southern limit and the same portion of and island forming with the ice pack the western border within this area visiting all the shores named among which as specially may be mentioned herald and islands respecting which the only knowledge existing was that two bodies of land were known to lie there one of which in fact was previously considered almost till the work of the of steamer in the ocean and the has defined it farther work will undoubtedly add other species to the list and the range of others but it is thought the present paper will give a very good idea of the bird life of the regions visited having the continent of america on the one side and asia on the other it might be anticipated that we should secure specially rich results from the of two yet although this is true to a certain extent there are reasons to prevent the very marked exhibition of this the first is the of the region within the limits inhabited by a and in consequence frequented by many species of wide distribution the next is the of the two barren coast lines and islands offering but small to land birds while the sea birds as usual are species common to extended the usually low but rolling coast country a monotonous grass grown plain varied by or moss covered slopes or wind swept hills back far into the interior are the only variations to the general level here and there a few pieces of break the cold gray of the beach while clusters of native huts or tents lend a passing interest to the cheerless coast thus offering but slight for birds as might well be expected the former region north of straits is entirely and south of straits in sea the water birds may be divided into two groups those the deep water surrounding the fur seal and strait islands and the adjoining coast for the first group and the shallow water species along the shore from the mouth of the river to the vicinity of straits the former group the and allied species also the and s and the second group such species as the goose the and many of the fresh and water ducks this distinction of the two shores holds also to a certain extent north of straits these two shores having there somewhat the same relationship i have just mentioned there is also a difference still more striking to be noted between the species the sea of straits and those to the south north of the straits the are very rare while south throughout the islands over all the other islands of sea except along its eastern border including even the islands in straits they swarm in the greatest abundance while the presence in sea of several other si including and not found north of the straits makes the difference still more striking beyond these differences however it is difficult to divide the region into any well marked districts though along some parts of the coast the breeding water fowl fill the with life yet the rocky islands of sea are the places about which birds exist in the greatest s and as baron d well remarks in his account of the s voyage it is not the larger inhabitants of the regions such as the whale bear and seal which first attract the s attention but the innumerable flocks of birds that swarm around the traveller during the long summer day of the north and this is striking about any of the islands which birds the and â seek as breeding places the islands of straits resemble enormous about which the birds swarm in countless numbers filling the air with their swiftly moving forms in every direction and the waters are covered with them all about the islands while every point and place where can be obtained is taken possession of by them for breeding places although herald island is almost perpetually surrounded by the ice yet we found it with and as were also some of the on island still to the westward on some of the islands visited by the crew on their retreat towards the coast this was also found to be the case as mr me and they found there in extreme abundance although the islands were surrounded by an almost unbroken ice pack for the benefit of visiting this region in future i will mention a few where certain species of considerable interest may be obtained the emperor goose is quite abundant on the portion of saint island the low flat portion of the island by the islands of strait are all of them resorted to by the and least and the islands in particular are frequented by of us the ocean of them the summer season along the coast of from just north of straits to wherever the shore is low and bordered by or shallow river mouths occur the s and the king in great numbers according to the emperor goose also visits this coast at we found s in excessive abundance during our stay there as detailed in the following pages the coast from icy to point is also frequented by the king in great abundance the nest in large numbers upon a small rocky just oft island at the head of the sound and also upon the cliff s the northern shore of sound in sea especially those at and s is found rather commonly upon the rivers flowing into the head of sound especially along the some small rocky in the middle of pass near in the islands are the breeding places of the beautiful little

of woman as to render this long future as pleasing in its aspect as she can and what so degrading and so utterly at with the beauty of the female character as having once secured a legal claim to the protection of a husband ever afterwards to neglect those personal attractions which comparatively few women have to be charged with in their single state yet of what importance is it to the careless observer we meet with in general society how we dress or whether we look well or ill compared with what it is to the man who has to see us and perhaps us alone seated opposite to him at every meal of what importance is it to the stranger that we play badly or do not play at all â that we draw without taste and have never learned to converse with and ease his happiness is in no way dependent upon us he can turn away and forget us the next moment but the case a widely different character when we look at it as extending through each separate hour of a long lifetime and surely if there he a natural exultation in having charmed an indifferent person or even a whole party for an hour there must be a higher and far more reasonable satisfaction in being able to a husband of his cares to win him from society which might divert his thoughts from home and to render that home not only the scene of his duties but of his favorite amusements and his dearest joys to this high purpose every intellectual should also be made for there is much in the life of men and particularly where business their attention to lower and the mind there is much to render it purely material in its aims and calculations and there is much also in man s public intercourse with his fellow man to render him eager and in that which in himself while at the same time he is regardless or of others as a rational and immortal being he consequently needs a companion who will be for the advancement of his intellectual moral and spiritual nature a companion who will raise the tone of his mind from the low anxieties and vulgar cares which necessarily occupy so large a portion of his existence and lead his thoughts to or repose on those subjects which convey a feeling of identity with a higher state of existence beyond this present life instead of this how often does the wife receive home her weary husband to render him still more weary by an of all the gossip she has heard through the day of the observations she has made upon her neighbor s furniture and way of living of the personal attentions or she has received with a long catalogue of complaints against her servants and worse than all ten thousand reasons strengthened by that day s experience why she should be indulged with some favorite article of dress or luxury upon which her heart has long been set it may be said in of this mode of conduct that the occupations of men of business in the present day are such and so pressing as to leave them little time and perhaps less inclination for interesting themselves in subjects of apparently less urgent and immediate importance and that consequently all endeavor to give their minds a bias in favor of nobler things would be but in reply to this observation i would ask one question â have you made the experiment have you ever tried whether the introduction of a new idea and agreeably clothed might not be made quite as agreeable as the introduction of a new article of diet even dressed with the care have you then made the experiment for here lies the secret of all the good we can reasonably expect if for instance you should begin to talk about the stars when your husband asks for his slippers or quote poetry when he wants his dinner the would scarcely be wild enough to anticipate any very favorable result the first thing to be done in the of this high object is to use what influence you have so as not to lower or the habitual train of your husband s thoughts and the next is to watch every eligible opportunity and to use every suitable means of leading him to view his favorite subjects in their and most light while at the same time it is within the region of woman s to connect them by some delicate mode of association with the general bearing of a man s interests in this world upon his interests in eternity it is extremely difficult in writing on this subject to convey my exact meaning or indeed to avoid the charge of wishing to recommend instead of pleasant easy fireside chat the introduction of a dull and dry or perhaps discourse than which nothing can be more opposed both to the tastes and the habits of the writer as well as to her ideas of the nice art of pleasing and doing good at the same time indeed that mode of conversation which i have been accustomed to describe as talking en a large scale is except on very important occasions most i the wives op england to the natural softness and of woman it is not in fact her but belongs to a region of display in which she cannot or at least ought not to shine the excellence of woman as regards her conversation consists rather of quick and delicate and sometimes playful turns of thought with a lively and subtle apprehension of the bearings tendencies and associations of ideas so that the whole machinery of conversation if i may be allowed to use such an expression may be made by her good management to turn off from one subject and play upon another as if by the direction of ,7

a tall fellow swift of foot and long he was generally equipped in a half indian dress with belt and his hair hung in straight gallows locks about his ears and added not a little to his it is an old

equal truth that the back wood men of are half man half horse and half by the on the and held accordingly in great respect and history of the above character may have presented itself to the garrison

drunk whenever he could get liquor and stealing whatever he could lay his hands on every day or two he was sure to get a sound for some of his which however as it broke no bones he made very light of and not to repeat the offence whenever another opportunity presented sometimes in consequence of some he would from the garrison and be absent for a month at a time about the woods and with a long on his shoulder laying in for game or himself down on the edge of a pond catching fish for hours together and bearing no little resemblance to that notable bird the mud when he thought his crimes had been forgotten or forgiven he would back to the fort with a bundle of skins or a bunch of poultry which perchance he had stolen and would exchange them for liquor with which having well soaked his he would lay in the sun and enjoy all the luxurious of that philosopher he was the terror of all the farm yards in the country into which he made fearful and sometimes he would make his sudden appearance at the garrison at daybreak with the whole neighbourhood at his heels like a scoundrel thief of a fox detected in his and hunted to his hole such was this and from the total indifference he showed to the world or its concerns and from his truly indian and no one would ever have dreamed that he would have been the of the treachery of hi new york when the was going on which proved so fatal to the

formerly been obliged to in consequence of misfortune in business that is to say having been detected in the act of sheep stealing after wandering many days in the woods toiling through swimming various rivers and a world of hardships that would have killed any other being but an indian a back wood man or the devil he at length arrived half and as a starved at where he stole a and over to new

fronts are back in narrow eight or ten miles from the sound a similar point out into the sound five or six miles to the south while the missing portion is and forms a all the cape is save a narrow strip about a mile long composed of large against which the waves beat with loud roaring a bar of foam a mile or so farther out showed where the waves were breaking on a part of the and i supposed that we would be compelled to pass around it in deep water but toy usually so cautious determined to cross it and after giving particular directions with an encouraging shout every oar and was strained to shoot through a narrow gap just at the most critical point a big wave heaved us aloft and dropped us between two huge rounded where had the been a foot or two closer to either of them it must have been smashed though i had offered no objection to our experienced pilot s plan it looked dangerous and i took the precaution to my shoes so they could be quickly shaken off for swimming but after crossing the bar we were not yet out of danger for we had to struggle hard to keep from being driven ashore while the waves were beat the return to fort ing us on at length we discovered a little into which we gladly escaped a pure white to the form of a cross stood amid of and the black rocks of the wave beaten shore in sign of safety and welcome a good fire soon warmed and dried us into common comfort our narrow escape was the burden of conversation as we sat around the fire captain told us of two similar adventures while he was a strong young man in both of them his was smashed and he swam ashore out of the with a gun in his teeth he says that if we had struck the rocks he and mr young would have been drowned all the rest of us probably would have been saved then turning to me he asked me if i could have made a fire in such a case without matches and found a way to without or food we started about daybreak from our blessed white cross harbor and after a bluff cape opposite the mouth of a fleet of came in sight and of course i was eager to trace them to their source naturally enough was greatly excited about the safety of his and begged that we should not venture to force a way through the the loss of the and our lives now that we were so near the end of our long voyage oh never fear i replied you know we are always lucky â the weather is good i only want to see the thunder for a few minutes and should the be packed close travels in i promise to turn back and wait until next summer thus assured he pushed rapidly on until we entered the where we had to go cautiously slow the were close packed almost throughout the whole extent of the but we managed to reach a point about two miles from the head â commanding a good view of the down lower end of the and blue jagged ice wall this was one of the most imposing of the first class i had as yet seen and with its magnificent formed a fine triumphant close for our season s ice work i made a few notes and sketches and turned back in time to escape from the of before dark then was stationed in the bow to guide through the open portion of the mouth of the and across strait it was not until several hours after dark that we were finally free from ice we occasionally encountered on the which in the seemed to extend in every direction our danger lay in breaking the on small hard to see and in getting too near the larger ones that might split or roll over oh when will we escape from this ice moaned much enduring old we ran in several places in crossing the but finally succeeded in groping our way over muddy before the tide fell and â on the shore of a small island where we discovered a spot dry enough to sleep on after tumbling about in a of bushes and logs the return to fort we left our last camp november at daybreak the weather was calm and bright island came into view beneath a lovely rosy sky all the forest down to the water s edge silvery gray with a of snow john and seemed to be seriously distressed to find themselves at the end of their journey while a portion of the stock of provisions remained what is to be done about it they asked more than half in earnest the fine strong and deliberation of indians was well illustrated on this trip it was fresh every morning they all behaved well however exerted themselves under tedious hardships without for days or weeks at a time never seemed in the least were prompt to act in every good as servants fellow and even friends we landed on an island in sight of and built a big smoky signal fire for friends in town then set sail our flag and about noon completed our long journey of seven or eight hundred miles as we approached the town a large of friendly indians came flying out to meet us cheering and in boston fashion the friends of mr young had intended to come out in a body to welcome him back but had not had time to complete their arrangements before we landed mr young was eager for news i told him there could be no news of importance about a town we only had real news drawn from the wilderness the mail steamer had ,13
way down the valley i turned again and again to gaze on the glorious picture throwing up my arms to it as in a frame after long ages of growth in the darkness beneath the through sunshine and storms it seemed now to be ready and waiting for the elected artist like yellow wheat for the and i could not help wishing that i might carry colors and with me on my travels and learn to paint in the mean time i had to be content with photographs on my mind and sketches in my note books at length after i had rounded a that puts out from the west wall of the valley eveiy peak vanished from sight and i pushed rapidly along the frozen meadows over the divide between the waters of the and and down through the forests that clothe the slopes of cloud s best arriving in in due time â which a near view of the high with me is any time and strange to say among the first people i met here were two artists who with letters of introduction were awaiting my return they inquired whether in the course of my in the adjacent mountains i had ever come upon a landscape suitable for a large painting whereupon i began a description of the one that had so lately excited my admiration then as i went on further and further into details their faces began to glow and i offered to guide them to it while they declared that they would gladly follow far or near i could spare the time to lead them since storms might come breaking down through the fine weather at any time the colors in snow and cutting off the artists retreat i advised getting ready at once i led them out of the valley by the and falls thence over the main dividing ridge to the big meadows by the old trail and thence along the upper river to its head this was my companions st excursion into the high and as i was almost always alone in my the way that the fresh beauty was reflected in their faces made for me a novel and interesting study they naturally were affected most of all by the colors â the intense of the sky the of the granite the red and of dry meadows and the purple and crimson of the flaming yellow of gi the silvery flashing of the streams and the bright green and blue of the lakes but the general the mountains of sion of the scenery â rocky and savage â seemed sadly and as they the forest from ridge to ridge eagerly the as they were unfolded they said all this is huge and sublime but we see nothing as yet at all available for effective pictures art is long and art is limited you know and here are middle gi all alike bare rock waves woods groves of meadow and of water never mind i replied only bide a and i will show you something you like at length toward the end of the second day the crown began to come into view and when we had fairly rounded the projecting before mentioned the whole picture stood revealed in the flush of the their enthusiasm was excited beyond bounds and the more impulsive of the two a young dashed ahead shouting and and tossing his arms in the air like a madman here at last was a typical landscape after awhile on the view i proceeded to make camp in a sheltered grove a little way back from the meadow where pine boughs could be obtained for beds and where there was plenty of wood for fires while the artists ran here and there along the river and up the sides of the choosing for sketches after dark when our tea was made and a rousing fire had been built we began to make our plans they decided to remain several days at the least while i con a view of the high to make an excursion in the mean time to the untouched summit of bitter it was now about the middle of october the of snow flowers the first winter clouds had already and the peaks were strewn with fresh without however affecting the climbing to any dangerous extent and as the weather was still profoundly calm and the distance to the foot of the mountain only a little more than a day i felt that i was running no great risk of being storm bound mount is king of the mountains of the middle portion of the high as of the north and of the south sections moreover as far as i know it had never been i had the adjacent wilderness summer after summer but my studies thus far had never drawn me to the top of it its height above sea level is about feet and it is round by inclined and of tremendous depth and which render it almost inaccessible but difficulties of this kind only the next morning the artists went heartily to their work and i to mine former experiences had given good reason to know that passionate storms invisible as yet might be brooding in the calm therefore before bidding farewell i warned the artists not to be alarmed should i fail to appear before a week or ten days and advised them in case a snow storm should set in to keep up big fires and shelter themselves as best they could and the mountains of on no account to become frightened and attempt to seek their way back to alone through the my general plan was simply this to scale the wall cross over to the eastern flank of the range and then make my way southward to the northern spurs of mount in compliance with the intervening for to push on directly southward from camp through the innumerable peaks ,13
than miles per hour with the best of double tracks through a remarkably level everything put out of its way and no more stops than its own necessities of wood and water require we should easily beat this in america with anything like equal and without charging the british price â â s or over for a distance not equal to the length of the railroad almost wholly through a and busy where coal is most abundant and very cheap f at our train the mail started from london at a m and should have been here at p m or in a little less than miles per hour but the running throughout the country is now with excursion trains and of passengers on low excursion return tickets to see the great exhibition which is quite as it should be but the consequent delay and of the regular trains is as it should not be the companies have no moral right to fish up a quantity of irregular and temporary business to the of their promises and the serious disappointment of their regular customers as things are managed we left london with a train of cars half of them filled with excursion for whom a separate engine should have been but was not provided so that we were behind time from the first and arrived here at this morning instead of last night the spirit of accommodation is not strikingly evinced on british the train at a place to which you are a stranger and you perhaps hear its name called out for the benefit of the passengers who are to stop there but whether the halt is to last half a minute five minutes or ten you must find out as you can the french are better in this respect and the american cannot be worse though the fault is not unknown there a penny programme for each train to be sold at the chief stations on each important route stating not at what place but exactly how long each halt of that particular train would be made is one of the yet wants of railroad our path and railway guides undertake to tell so much that plain people are confused and often by them and are unable to pick out the little information they actually need from the wilderness of figures and facts set before them let us have guides so simple that no guide is needed to explain them there is much in english rural scenery i have now nearly a thousand miles in this country i â england central and without seeing anything like a mountain and hardly a precipice except the cliffs of the sea shore nearly every acre i have seen is susceptible of cultivation and of course either cultivated built upon or devoted to wood a few steep banks of streams or almost uniformly wooded and some small mainly on the sea coast are all the exceptions i remember to the general capacity for cultivation usually the aspect of the country is pleasant â beautiful if you choose â but calculated to excite wonder or enthusiasm the abundance of hedges is its most striking characteristic i judge that of england is in grass meadow or pasture very green and and dotted with noble herds of cattle and flocks of sheep they are anxious to finish hay making throughout the region we traversed yesterday but as there has been scarcely an hour of very sunshine during the last six days more than half of which have been rainy the operation is one rather trying to human patience some of the cut grass looks as if it were spread out to rot and of it a want of shelter this is almost fair though so that the necessity of taking in and drying the hay by a fire may be but a great deal of it must be seriously p s o clock â it is cloudy and again wheat covers perhaps an eighth of all central england is now and heavy but much of it is down by the wind and rain and looks as if a herd of had been chased through it by a tribe of mounted indians if the weather should be mainly fair henceforth the crop may be saved but it must already have received material damage and the process of it must be is considerably grown and has also been a good deal have suffered less being more backward â potatoes look vigorous though not yet out of danger from or rot not a patch of indian corn is to be seen throughout ble grass â sm at land has been up for wheat next season and some are just visible but it is evident that grass and stock under the influence of the low prices of grain produced by the of the corn laws are steadily gaining upon of course throwing of thousands of agricultural out of employment and driving them to to or the poor house thus the rural population of england is steadily and constantly the best feature of english landscape is formed by its trees though rarely relied on for fuel there is scarcely an area of forty acres without them while single trees more rarely rows and often petty forests are visible in all quarters the trees are not the straight tall trim short c of france and italy but wide spreading hospitable oaks and other sturdy with wind and storm which have a far more genial and satisfactory appearance and the trees of england have a commercial as well as a less value for timber of all sorts is in demand in the and mines and bears a high price the consumption far exceeding the domestic supply but for the trees these sullen skies and level grounds would render england dreary enough is the of one of those immense which illustrate the greatness and pecuniary strength of britain and illustrate also the of ,8

sit down to read or study nor an example of home comfort and in their own class to profit by in those narrow earth straw there is no room for the father and his sons to sit down and enjoy an evening so they off to the nearest or other den in search of the comfort their home them of course men who have grown up in this way have no idea of anything better and are slow to mend but the personal influence of their in wealth and station is very great and might be ten times greater if the more fortunate class would make themselves familiar with the wants and woes the feelings and aspirations of the poor and act toward them as friends and wiser brethren instead of seeming to regard them only as strange dogs to be or at sheep to be but the first practical point to be struggled for is that of steady employment and just reward for labor so long as men s wages without board range from to one and six pence per day and women s from a penny to six pence which so far as i can learn are the current at present and nothing to do for half the year at any price no radical improvement can be hoped for a family with nothing to do very little to eat and only a pen to live in will neither acquire mental moral integrity nor habits of neatness and industry on the contrary however deficient they may originally be in these respects they are morally certain to grow worse so long as their circumstances remain unchanged but draw them out of their wretched into a neat dry glass lighted comfortable dwelling offer them work at all seasons and a fair for doing it and you will have at least rendered improvement p the of cleanliness will the love south of it at least in the younger members the opportunity of earning will awaken the instinct of saving as well as the desire to maintain a comely appearance in the eyes of friends and neighbors the well paid will naturally be fed and both able and willing to perform thrice the work per day he now does or can seeing the more efficient often step above them to posts better paid and more respected the workers will to greater knowledge and skill in order that they too may attain more eligible positions it is the first step that costs â the others follow almost of course if the aristocracy of ireland would resolve that every individual in the land should henceforth have constant work and just the involved need not be great and the return would be abundant and certain they have ample water power for a thousand machine shops c which has run to waste since creation and can never bring them a dollar while irish industry remains as rude ill paid and as it now is every dollar wisely spent in improving this power will add two to the value of their estates so they have stone of immense value all over the island which never produced anything and never will while the millions live in and confine their attention to growing and potatoes for a alone and especially such can never employ the people when the and potatoes have been the peasant has very little to do but eat them until the season for planting them returns but introduce a hundred new arts and processes â let each village have its each county its of the various wares

the three millions glances at europe of new england although the in new england are at least as industrious and efficient ad the natives they work well everywhere but at home because they everywhere else find the more powerful class ready to employ them instruct pay them in ireland alone are they required to work for six pence to eighteen pence per day and even at these stand idle half the year for want of anything to do so that the rent which they would readily double for better if they were fully employed and fairly paid now and them and their little patches of land which ought to be in the highest degree productive are often the worst cultivated of any this side of the ignorance want and have their energies and the consequent decay of the has involved most of the aristocracy in the general ruin the estates commission is now rapidly passing the soil of ireland out of the hands of its into those of a new generation may these be wise enough to profit by the warning before them and by to the condition of the laboring millions place their own prosperity on a solid and lasting foundation general aspects the south of ireland is decidedly more fertile and inviting than the north or

the whole party started for the mr by reason of the delicacy of his health in a pony carriage belonging to the hotel with mrs while the rest followed on foot what reason mrs had for the use of a wheel carriage did not appear it was certainly not because of her years indeed she looked particularly fresh and as mr rather added blooming doubtless she was excited by having such a distinguished person as the new arrival for her companion the pair on wheels had to make a little to reach the top of the hill which afforded opportunity for a little private conversation if the lady was interested in the history of tne house of the gentleman did not disdain to put a question or two respecting that of nobility he observed in answer to some flattering remarks of his companion was no doubt an excellent institution but what become of it were not its ranks from the great names in commerce that st in connection with the useful calling â or might he hot term it an art â of was not unknown to him this fact was yery pleasing to mrs s ears and secretly a little surprised ner my late husband she nevertheless replied was indeed very well known i believe a great name on change assented mr quoting from he was not quite sure what at a venture yes indeed said mrs applying her handkerchief to her eyes it was only when they lost him however that they found out my dear s value she meant his moral worth but the word change no doubt had led mr s mind into more material channels for he replied i remember reading his wiu in the papers he left a fortune did he not he left me very off said mrs modestly

am afraid i have touched a tender sir i only meant that you too have the partner of your joys yes he replied quietly it was a long time ago when my was quite a child but one does not forget such things still one ought toâ don t you in time observed mrs one ought he assented one does sometimes he glanced at the widow with what she thought the most gentlemanly sigh she had ever heard and then fixed his eyes on the splash board your daughter seems a most charming young lady observed mrs after an interval of silence and embarrassment she was making the very same remark to me this morning about yours replied mr is generally admired â that is in our own comparatively humble circle of society said mrs with humility beauty and accomplishments my dear madam are a nobility in themselves

of our time in life â or rather i should say of mine for as and i were agreeing one can scarcely believe that miss can be a daughter of r own â the contemplation of the pleasures of our children is one of the few we have left to us see yonder how our young people are enjoying themselves and he pointed with his whip to where and accompanied by and could be seen approaching them by a short cut

that the end is s is quite sincere the flame doesn t bum very fiercely but then his nature is not a great nature like s and our natures give â overlook the â only what they are capable of giving but though a flame throw out little heat and lights it is a flame for all that and the faintest flame is worthy of our respect all the same i don t think that a should ever take office from the english government and edward marched off to his tower to his third act which and i had agreed he never would be able to write satisfactorily came to till a little before edward s play was finally refused by and myself and seated himself firmly on the fence as is his wont edward i believe continued to consult him regarding the and i were daily proposing all the same his name was omitted â rom that part of my narrative â he seemed a side issue â and in i was obliged to cast him out again but now my narrative demands his presence and his voice and i hasten to tell that as soon as edward left me in street the reader remembers that he refused to advise me regarding the political situation s name occurred to me he seemed to be on the instant the very person who could guide me through the of irish political and my steps turned mechanically from the hotel whither i was going towards c are street a few minutes later i was on s door step asking myself why had chosen to confide in edward rather than in me and hoping for a long talk with him after the reading of the play scruples of conscience are my and i was concerned about his future being naturally ms hon pour la that is to say on the it seemed to me that he was bound to consider not only hail and farewell himself but his wife and his children my thoughts turned about them while i read the play and when the reading was over for s talk threw no light upon the political questions that then agitated ireland he is always and vague without much power of but that night it was easy to see that his thoughts were elsewhere he will confide in me presently i said and to lead him into confidence i spoke of the express which had then spent all the capital that had been advanced by mr it was not that would put any more capital into the newspaper and after a little discourse as to what might be done with this newspaper if a could be found mentioned that he had been offered the post of secretary to the department that s the best bit of news i ve heard this long while edward told me that you had consulted him but he thinks that on account of the pledge i am no longer a member of parliament but my sympathies are with my friend john who to take the rough with the smooth seems to be doing very well but edward and some others who advised you against accepting the post haven t considered your interests and they do right answered not to consider my interests my interests don t count with me for a moment what i am thinking is that may miss a magnificent chance if he has nobody by him who knows the country but is an is a and a can never know ireland a that has always lived in ireland even so ireland is catholic if she is anything and you re a catholic first of all for you abandoned the plan of campaign when the church condemned it certainly i did and what strikes me now is that it is hard if ireland should be deprived of the labour of one of her sons because he once was i ve written to on the subject and he rose from his chair and walked to his writing table will you read me the letter yes i u read it to you and when he had finished i said the letter you ve just read me is a very good letter but it fills me with apprehension for it seems to me that you leave to decide whether you should accept the appointment that he is offering you remember your wife and children if i were convinced that the best service i could render to ireland but what could you do for ireland better than to put your gift of co at the country s service yes co is the thing the of au detail to to the consideration of the main outline the general scheme yet i am not sure that at the head of a great newspaper i shouldn t be able to serve ireland better than as the secretary of the department or perhaps the great newspaper might come after the it will take some years to get the department into working order home rule is bound to come â hail and farewell sooner or later and the department will create an immense of officials all well equipped with ideas and the preparation of this great machine would be a task worthy of any man s talent when home rule comes there will be an immense change in the government of the country and very likely the old civil servants will be off if such a change were to happen it would interest me to take charge of a great daily and have you any idea of a policy for the paper what line do you ireland should take in the present crisis and while drawing the golden hair of his beard through his insignificant little hands began to tell me that unlike england ireland had never known how to

of were resorted to sometimes they would walk down to the old and suddenly double and get back through a of obscure streets or else they would publicly walk up and down the king s and when they thought no one was looking hurry up one of the by streets and so gain their haven the lane once they were in the lane they speed all danger was then over and they laughed at their escapes and delighted in telling each other how so and so and his daughter had been successfully avoided always had his latch key ready in a moment they were inside and frank would rush upstairs and throw himself into the arm chair crying here we are one day they were at the window when to their amazement the house carriage pulled up before the shop and they had only just time to behind the curtain and escape

listened to his sisters talking to his wife the girls â who were of e ignorant of their relationship to the â liked mrs very much and were fond of a chat with her and looking through the blinds frank saw the footman in all the splendour of six feet and grey livery carrying a small pot of flowers worth sixpence from the carriage to the shop on ordinary days the shop was shut at eight but when and frank dined there it was closed an hour earlier frank enjoyed his evenings there he enjoyed it all â the and the quiet he enjoyed seeing nurse the after dinner and he found no difficulty in pretending

cheek against his handsome face she would have probably rushed to death to serve him his height his brightness his rings his spotted â all seemed so perfect so beautiful to her and when he brought his

whom we shall not honestly believe to be a qualified according to the act of said territory that we will reject the of all and every non resident whom we shall believe to have come into the territory for the mere purpose of that in all cases where we are ignorant of the s right we will require legal evidence thereof by his own oath or otherwise that we will make a true and faithful return of the

dwell on the agreeable future while she went as she said to tempt to let the miss hear what good singing really was slept all the better for her pleasant prospect of the morrow and in the morning was pronounced by madame to have made so much progress as to be quite equal to sitting up for a few hours in the dressing room arranged cushions for effect as well as comfort on the little couch and made the most arrangement of books flowers and fancy works with a girlish pleasure in setting out to the greatest advantage for her lover was such a pretty invalid that she needed none of these attractions but still they were finishing touches of a picture every detail of which mr might carry away in his heart whether he did so or whether it had only room for he himself could best tell after he had spoken his last word and looked his last look his heart sunk a little as he left her at the thought how many things might go wrong before he saw her again meanwhile had sped her parting guests the who very sincerely expressed themselves very sorry to go and she had done the kindest thing she could by persuading paul to attend them home on his return he seemed much pleased the old lady as he called her had in and on his going in and her and had invited him to dine there quite in an way the following week that evening the party was very small and rather quiet was very feverish all the more so perhaps for three or four little notes from mr brought to her at intervals by the who while any demand for vigilance in the invalid room remained took of madame played preference with m mr came and went collecting his books and drawings and persuading and to give him a good many drawings of their own besides helping himself to as many as he liked with permission from s he had also managed to obtain from the soft hearted the beautiful of hair and sat over a board moving the pieces but conversing very earnestly in low tones less audible than whispers they were both very anxious about her future prospects the next day the party was yet smaller without much regard for her health managed to be dressed and carried into the time enough to receive mr s last talked earnestly and sorrowfully to instead of eating his breakfast and soon â too soon â the was at the door were spoken again and again and soon the travellers were seen fast driving down u and the lime tree avenue watched them till they disappeared and then turned away with a heavy heart paul observed they should be very dull now and wished he could do anything for her for that he felt quite to her this sounded like quite a sensible observation from him and told him that if he would make a collection of birds feathers for miss may them on cards and write the names under them she was sure would like it very much this set paul to work for hours she was glad to have found an s employment for him for the weather was breaking up very much and winter coming on fast consented to her visit for a week for the sake of cheering up her young friends and virtue was its own reward for they cheered her too and she returned home with her mind stored with agreeable and self memories â no bad provision for the evening of life as for paul she declared his visit had quite brightened him up and indeed a great deal of the mould and had really been rubbed off and he too had his agreeable memories to fall back on throughout the whole of the winter frequently alluding to them when warmly shut in for the evening with the preface i say aunt do you remember when we were making that pleasant visit at with those pretty girls the mr and would have written had and it not been for a fear of m s their confidential letters m now began to talk of returning to his warm house in the old cathedral town for the winter every allusion to which filled with pain and fear for she knew her was intended closely to follow she procured from time to time on the plea that was not yet strong enough to travel and though m considered the objection of no moment and in s absence spoke of her as little more than a superior servant full paid and for her services he yielded oftener than might have been expected perhaps from a natural preference for the present lull to the commotion he was aware would take place when was commanded to submit to the thus time wore away and heavily till m definitely fixed the day for the journey there was a agreement to say nothing of the hateful ceremony as long as it could be avoided but felt its dreary shadow surrounding her farewell visits were paid to and the in spite of the horses being scarcely able to through the mud and once or twice they literally stuck fast these excursions were good preparations said for her longer journey the good took leave of them with tears and her young friends could not forbear weeping a uttle from sympathy even paul began to doubt whether he j and to find a use for his handkerchief and blew his nose by way of exciting his emotions you have been very kind to me always said he gazing tenderly on after putting her in the carriage that is â good bye paul â be very kind to your said â that is my parting and see if you can t get through peter the great this winter for i shall ask you next spring ,4
down our want of kindness and consideration to those who are gone before us to another world when we realize the sensation of bending over the feeble frame of a beloved friend when the mortal conflict is i and the fluttering spirit is about to its earthly and looking back upon a long dark past all blotted over with instances of our or neglect and forward unto that little span of life into which we would fain the deep affection that thb of in spite of in our past conduct has all the while been cherished in our hearts â with what ed earnestness would we arrest the pale messenger in his career and stay the wings of time and call upon the impatient spirit to return to see and feel and understand our love perhaps we have been in former seasons of bodily affliction have not listened patiently to the of natural feeling and have held ourselves excused from attendance in the sick chamber and there has gone forth that awful sentence it is the last time the last time we can offer the cordial draught or smooth the restless pillow or the feverish brow and now though we would search all the treasures of the earth for healing medicine and rob ourselves of sleep and rest and to purchase for the one hour of quiet slumber and pour our tears upon that aching brow until its burning heat was â it is in vain for the eye is glazed the lips are the head begins to and nature tells us it is all too late perhaps we have not been kind or tender in those by gone years of familiar confidence when we were called upon to share the burdens of a weary bosom whose inner feelings were revealed to us and us alone yes we can remember in the sunny days of youth and through the trials of when the appeals of affection were answered with or when followed and we could not if we had desired it then draw back the love we had and now we hear again that awful it is the last habits of time â the last time we can weep upon that or lay our hand upon that head or press a fond fond upon those closing lips fain we then throw open the flood gates of our hidden feeling and pour forth words of more than tenderness alas the once wished for tide would flow like the rising surf around a shattered wreck â too late perhaps we have been guilty of a deeper sin against our heavenly father and the human family whose happiness he has in some measure committed to our trust and oh let the young ask diligently of the more experienced how they can escape the aching consciousness that may pursue them to the grave and only then commence the reality of its eternal torment the consciousness of having wasted all our influence and neglected all our means of assisting those who were associated with us by the ties in preparing for another and a better world perhaps they once sought our society for the benefit of spiritual communion they would have consulted us in cases of moral had we been more gracious and perhaps we have treated lightly the serious scruples they have laid before us or what is still more probable perhaps the whole of our inconsistent lives has been the means of drawing them away from the altar on which they saw such incense burning and now it is the last time â the last time we can ever speak to them of eternity of the state of their trembling souls before the eye of a just and holy god or raise their fainting to the mercy still to their acceptance through him who is al to save to the oh for the thb of england trumpet of an to awake them from the increasing of bodily and spiritual death oh for a voice that would in one deep awful and tremendous word all for which our wasted life was insufficient it is in vain that we would call upon the attributes of nature and of deity to aid us they are gone it was the final struggle and never more will that pale marble form be roused to life by words of hope or consolation they are gone the of eternity are closed â it is too late let it be a subject of grateful acknowledgment with the young that to them this fearful sentence has not yet gone forth â that opportunity may still be offered them to redeem the time they know not however how much of this time remains at their disposal and it might occasionally be some assistance to them in their duties would they the habit of thinking not only of their own death but of the death of their companions there are few subjects more calculated for solemn and affecting thought than the fact that we can scarcely meet a blooming circle around a cheerful hearth but one in at least in that will be in her the seeds of some fatal malady it is recorded of the that amongst their an customs they endeavoured to preserve the remembrance that they were liable to death by placing at their boards a human skeleton so that while they and enjoyed the luxuries of this life they should find it impossible to themselves into a belief in its perpetual duration it is not necessary that we should resort to means so domestic habits of and repulsive though the end is still more desirable for us who are trusting in a better hope to keep in view neither is it necessary that the idea should be invested with melancholy and associated with depression it is but looking at the truth and let us deceive ourselves as we may the green church yard with its covered graves â the passing ,7

she retorted with dignity you have absolutely nothing left for yourself oh yes he laughed a man is never without miss means to make a pillow he always has his boots she shook her head decidedly you shall not lie down without your coat you would be sure to catch cold there is there is a better way wondered what she would suggest the candle had burned very low and would not last much longer put on

so however he put the remaining candle within easy reach and his also i am here he said when all was ready and now what the girl advanced toward him she knelt by his side and drew his left arm out from his body gazing intently into his eyes by the last glimmer of the candle she drooped her face nearer and nearer to his until their lips met it was the last thing on earth he had imagined the effect upon him for the moment was to turn him into stone then laid her head on the arm she had arranged for her pillow and saying good night went away to u l must s some m w chapter w i must confess some things the condition of the previous night was completely reversed then it was who slept and who lay awake until she could hear the regular breathing that showed he was unconscious now it was the young girl who allowed the arms of as well as those of her companion to her she was very tired for one thing the long ride in the hot sun the hard climb of the mountain side the uncertain footing in the cave during the four hours she had ascended and descended its winding ways had nearly exhausted her slight strength but more than this was the feminine longing for protection from the unseen dangers that might in that gloomy the child hides its head in its mother s lap and the world to injure it the woman in the extremity of fear seeks the arms of the man she loves the man she loves yes was the man that loved she had not meant he should know it for a long time yet but the circumstances proved too much for her her action told him what she might have concealed for months as her lips touched his he knew her secret and when her head pressed his arm a thrill passed through him nearly as tired as the girl soon by her side when he awoke he found her up and for an instant thought she bad wan miss from him she his fears by saying that she had just awakened and asked him to light a match and see what time it was a look at his watch showed that it was five in the morning or at least they both concluded it was morning knowing that it was seven at night when they lay down with the glimmer of the match the darkness seemed more than before as neither of them wanted sleep they began to talk of their situation and of the probability that would be able to reach them with a party it was clear to both that they must have wandered a good long way from the mouth of the cave otherwise some of their calls should have been heard by the guide said he had no fears for he would not have admitted any in the presence of this girl and she answered that no doubt they would be out by noon thankful that he could not see the faltering lip with which she made the statement i would give a thousand for a good breakfast all the same said you must be starved to death poor child i m not very hungry she answered i would rather have a good lamp than all the food in i don t like to have my room so dark at this time in the morning i must admit it s light enough outside he said with an attempt at humor if only our curtains weren t stuck down so they decided that it would be the height of folly to take a single step further when there was no way to tell whether they were going toward the entrance or away from it the best thing was to stay where they were listening for any sound that indicated human life the morning passed however and nothing came to give them the least encouragement at what seemed very long intervals would the cave for a moment while he consulted his watch only to find that less than an hour had usually elapsed since the last inspection of its face at last the womanly nature of gave way under the strain she put her arms around his neck and began to sob softly on his bosom they will never find us she said we shall be left here to die oh why did we ever come intensely distressed he kissed away her tears and tried to her pretending to have heard something that sounded like voices and bidding her hush that he might listen again when it was evident that nothing in the shape of human beings bore any trace of being near the girl resumed her weeping and clung passionately to her companion her entire frame shaken with her emotion we shall die here i am sure of it she said when she could speak you will ,5

one wrecked and floating on a in a wide and unknown sea of trouble sitting on the bed where she would never sleep again she watched dick counting on his fingers and looking into the spaces of some impossible future and asked herself what was to become of them for the twentieth time since she had a s wife them the robes of the fell from her and she became again in instincts and tastes a woman longing for s home a fixed and fireside where she might sit in the evening by her husband s side mending his shirts after the work of the day a bitter of her wandering life rose to her head and she longed to beg of her husband to give up and try to find some other employment and the next day it appeared to her more than usually sinful to drive to the station as the church bells were spending the hours that should have been passed in praying in playing nap smoking and talking of make and such like but apparently there was no help for it and on monday night in her excitement increased by the arrival of mr she could not help getting out of bed to god to be merciful to them her husband s heavy breathing often interrupted her but it told her that he was her husband and that was her only consolation it her that he could sleep as he did having in front of him the terrible to morrow when perhaps mr would cast them adrift and she trembled in every fibre when she stood on the stairs leading to the manager s room there was a great crowd the chorus girls themselves into a solid mass and murmured good mornings to each other told a long story from the top step tried to talk of to who listened and interested it was a question of a whilst till now silent as the dead suddenly woke up to the conclusion that it would probably all end in a of at last dick appeared and called them into the presence of mr and water was on the table and with the whiskers plunged in the a s wife black bag mr with many papers the looked very grave and at a heavy moustache and when they were all about him in his deepest and most earnest tones he explained his misfortunes for the last four months he had been forced to send down a weekly of not less than five and twenty pounds sometimes indeed the amount had run up to forty pounds this of course could not go on for ever he had not the bank of england behind but talking of banks although there was no reason why he should inflict on them an account of his bad luck he could not refrain from saying that had it not been for a certain bank he should be forced to ask them to accept half the words brought a flush of indignation to s cheeks she made a slight movement as if she were going to the suggestion violently but the silence of those around her and she contented herself with murmuring to this is an old i will leave you now said mr to consult among yourselves as to whether you will accept my proposal or if you would prefer me to break up the tour at the end of the week and pay you your back to london as mr left the room there was a murmur of inquiry from the chorus ladies and one or two voices were heard above the rest saying that they did not know how they could manage on less than five and twenty shillings a week these objections were soon silenced by dick who in a little speech explained that the of applied to the only then why these ladies and gentlemen by asking them to attend at this meeting said to this question dick made answer by telling the a s wife ladies and gentlemen of the chorus they might withdraw and the discussion was resumed by those whom it concerned objected to everything spoke of going back to liverpool explained his opinions on the management of theatres in general until dick summoned him back to the point were they or were they not going to accept half at length the matter was decided by getting upon a chair and shouting through his nose as through a pipe i don t know if you re all fond of hot weather but if you are you ll find it to your taste in london all the theatres are closed and the cats are on the this brought the argument to a pause during which remembered that were shot in august and settling her diamonds in her ears she agreed that the tour was to be continued a few more remarks were made and then the party to a neighbouring to talk of opera and bad business the next places they visited were and but the houses they played to were so poor that mr summoned a general meeting on the sunday morning and told them frankly that he could not go on losing money any longer he would however lend them the dresses and they might start a if they liked after much discussion it was decided to accept his offer and the afternoon was spent in striving to decide how the business was to be carried on a committee was at last formed consisting of dick and mr and they settled as they went on to by an evening train that the chorus was hit or miss to be paid in full and the then divided among the to the salary previously received in the face of the bad times it was a a s wife ment and the agent in advance was anxiously looked out for at the station what did he think was there ,3
the and traditions of his race else he will drift later on into or maybe go to live in cities like amongst statues but why do i trouble myself like this for there was a time before i had a son and the time is getting very close now when i shall lose him and dan stood swallowed up in the thought of the great gulf into which precarious health would soon pitch him out of sight of joseph for ever it was coming into the room that awoke him she too he muttered he began to fuss about seeking for writing materials for he was now intent to send joseph a letter of recommendation to the high priest having already forgotten the gulf that awaited him in the recollection of the courtesy and consideration he received from the most distinguished men the the brook last time he was in â from the son of and father in law of was now high priest the high priest of that year but in truth who had been high priest before him retained all the power and importance of the office and was even called the high priest dan remembered that he had been received with all the homage due to a man of wealth he liked his wealth to be acknowledged for it was part of himself he had created it and it was with pride that he continued his letter to his son to him saying that anything that was done to further joseph s interests would be a greater favour than any that could be conferred on himself the letter was sent off by special messenger and joseph was to carry it himself at once to which he did since it was his father s pleasure that he should do so he would have preferred to be allowed to pick his friends from among the people he met casually but since this was not to be he assumed the necessary reverence and came forward in the proper spirit to meet who expressed himself as entirely gratified by joseph s presence in and promised to support his election for the but if the reject me for you see i am still a young man the of joseph s remark pleased who smiled over it expressing a muttered hope that the would not take upon itself the task of discussing the merits and of those whom he should deem worthy to present for election the great man out these sentences joseph s remark having reminded him of his exalted position but thinking his remark had joseph said you see i have only just come to and this remark continued the flattery and with an impulsive movement took joseph s hands and spoke to him about his father in terms that made joseph feel very proud of dan and also of being in v v v the brook which had already begun to seem to him more wonderful t than he had imagined it to be and he had imagined it very wonderful indeed but there was a certain native in joseph and after leaving the high priest s place he had not taken many steps before he began to see through s plans which no doubt are laid with the view to impress me with the magnificence of and its he walked a few yards farther and remembered t that there are always among the jews and that the son of a rich man one of first rate importance in would be a valuable acquisition to the caste but though he saw through s designs he was still the of who was a clever man and a learned man c his importance loomed up very large and joseph could not be without a hero true or false so it could not be otherwise than that and and the whom v joseph met in the and whose houses he frequented commanded his admiration for several months and would have held it for many months more had it not been that he happened to be a religious man concerned much more with an intimate sense of god than with the of and he had accepted the sacrifices as part of a which should not be questioned and which he had never questioned yet without discussion without argument they fell in his estimation without pain as naturally as a leaf falls a friend quoted to him a certain well known passage in and not the whole of it only a few words and from that moment the temple the priests and the sacrifices became every day more distasteful to him than they were the day before setting him pondering on the d of the man who lives upon religion laughing in at his ie with the fellow that drives in his beast for slaughter and pays his yearly he remembered how he loved the instinctively though the priests always v s the brook seemed a little alien even before he knew them yet he never imagined them to be as far from true religion which f â i fc tne l of god as he found them for they did not try te from him knowing him to be a v friend of the high priest it had seemed to them that they might indulge their wit as they pleased and once he

how envied we were by a crowd of persons attired who not obtain seats at all but stood in and con tent with those fragments of discourse that reached them when the preacher rose upon the wind of doctrine higher than as for the british i con i was impressed by his whatever price he may have paid by the season for his position he took it all out in self and in my own place of worship after the service has begun a reasonable time those without seats are admitted into the as a matter of course but in the present case matters were very again and again would a lean over the door of some half and request permission to introduce some stranger only to meet with and shakes of the head the notion there was one individual of about sixty the sole tenant of a of considerable size who came under my of london life of a gentleman in church of all places in th j world in this manner â with a picture of g the good actually throwing warm upon his shirt front from the painted win dow â would have been really humorous but for the sad seriousness of the matter what stolid ignorance of the cause of their being in that edifice at all must possess such persons what a and indistinct idea must they enter tain of the great system which they flatter them selves they support by paying their rents how delicately the must have observation him no official had ventured to ask for room probably because they knew him too well so he sat surrounded by space presently however a young lady of great personal attractions who was standing in the with her mother aroused this gentleman s benevolence he nodded to her in a manner and when she took no notice of that he beckoned to her at the same time opening the door upon this she bowed and accepted his offer of a seat her elderly relative attempted to follow whereupon this individual quietly reached forward and shut the door between them with a leaving mamma outside i never felt so much inclined to write to the times lights and shadows picked his pastoral way never to have suggested to these people even the first of christian conduct i the art of how not to do it however was in this reverend gentleman s sermon carried to perfection there not being one single miserable sinner present in that fashionable chapel whose income was less than five hundred a year he depicted the vices of the poor in glowing colours while the rest of his discourse was solely directed against the â not present never did i behold a congregation i do not say more for i hope i am myself but more obviously conventional in every particular he might just as well have directed his efforts against the of the prophet said i when we got into the natural air outside is the last time well well said he i know what you are and yet there were numbers of good people taking notes of what was said as though poor had been st of london life going to say i confess was not very practical this morning but last sunday i never heard anything more excellent and if you will only try once more say next sunday i will that he is good again my dear friend remarked i gloomily i dare say you are right it is only that i am unfortunate when i happen to make one of a we never catch anything by any chance but the day before i am assured they caught seventy three dozen and the day after was one totally in the way of success so is it with me and the fashionable i will never leave my parish church again come home and lunch with me replied mr gaily after some salt fish and you will feel quite a different being i have no doubt of that replied i but i prefer to eat something that i can at the crystal palace the crowd at victoria station about mid day on good friday was something tremendous and vol ii l lights and shadows was composed entirely of that description of person who boast a sunday coat the upper ten thousand have many coats and a much larger number of our fellow citizens have only one but neither of these classes were bound to hear mr sing a song of sixpence or very little more in the at i believe it was the concert considering the talent engaged that was ever given and the audience was large quarter after quarter struck the but still the would be pleasure remained at that station growing flatter and flatter by reason of the increasing pressure but without losing one drop of good humour i cannot be persuaded that persons are very vicious who behave with this admirable patience here were five thousand people or so huddled together in an open pen with nothing to do and conscious that their one holiday of the year was slipping away from them in that unsatisfactory manner and yet i did not hear a single expression of â far less any wicked words listening as usual or london life t with all my ears i heard mr the dean s son freely the railway authorities for their want of but i heard no one else yet it was nothing to him whether mr should have finished his last shake or not before we arrived and nothing to me who had lost my temper long ago as i always do when i m kept waiting we both received a lesson of and long suffering which i hope was not thrown away upon us it was quite impossible that anybody but the boys â who climbed up the iron and sat on the as usual â could have enjoyed ,12
in her hand offering it to him but he made no move to take it why do you not give it to him yourself he asked because i am sure you will not betray me i am going to leave him as soon as opportunity

won t you please give it to him i am sorry to refuse but i really cannot mix in the their marriage bond affair he answered the chief steward or the might accommodate you but for very strong reasons i cannot a look of deep distress her features and there was a suspicion of moisture in her dark eyes she said good morning again not angrily and went toward the dining saloon i suppose i ve been fearfully said to himself but really t don t see what else i could have done not married to eh well as she says i never believed she was it s one of those that good men fall into in their youth and according to what she says it ends here he will go back to and marry miss who will never know of the i wonder he mused what she would say if she did know of it there would be an end to her wedding preparations i guess she s not the sort of woman to stand a thing like this if it came to her ears margaret found that the head steward was busy and on reflection thought it best not to give him her note yet for fear of accident soon after she knocked on s door i think you will have to hasten said she it will take some time for you to dress and pack she added as he opened the i have been up for an hour and a half and have only just finished at the hotel to which we are going she continued in a whisper there must be no more of mr and mrs you are again to be and i margaret rivers when he was ready they walked to the saloon where went through the form of declaring to the officials that he had no goods either in his baggage r that of his wife for this purpose he was obliged their marriage bond to answer to the name recorded on the passenger list then they went to breakfast eating the meal in comparative silence had taken his breakfast already and left the table the other passengers around them were at the prospect of being so soon on shore a number of ladies whom margaret had never seen made their appearance the inevitable found on all atlantic who keep their during an entire voyage on account of were being exchanged with promises to write always so at the end of a voyage between people who have formed which they believe will be lasting the brightness and bustle struck a chill to margaret s heart most of those around her were going to happy homes after some months or years of absence she alone seemed to have come to a foreign land where no one knew her and where she had no hope of anything more than the if indeed she was so lucky as to find that they went upon the deck where absent pointed out to her the islands of the harbor and the buildings on shore as well as the spider s web which the great bridge appears to the distant sight he could not talk of much else for fear of making a scene the attitude of the couple joined to the dejected appearance of margaret and the mourning that she wore caused comment among the passengers who decided again that the american had married an english wife who had lately suffered some great the belief settled down to a deceased mother whom she and her husband had gone to to bury at last the steamer reached her dock and was made their marriage bond fast the plank was arranged and the passengers alighted with little delay passed the and he was soon on the way to a hotel with his companion their hands stole together as they rode through the streets but neither dared utter more than when they drew up in front of the mr asked the girl to remain for a few moments in the carriage while he inquired if suitable rooms could be obtained as it was a time when he supposed the house would be quite full he had hardly passed out of sight when margaret made a quick resolve and acted upon it she had given up the plan of asking the head steward of the steamer to deliver the little note of farewell which had offered to mr she had in the suggestion that should remain with her for a day or two until he could find her a situation with the understanding that all relations but those of friendship should cease between them from the time they landed but when he alighted to look for their rooms a fright seized her she was morally certain that the rooms he would select would communicate with each other she knew how hard it was for him to give her up and she dreaded putting her weak strength of mind against his strong one should she enter that hotel she did not know how she could resist if he opposed her

insane folly but what i said just now is true i have never forgotten that i was your wife with his arm supporting her reassured her with comforting words and sustained by his confidence she told him of her folly in trusting of her giving him her of everything can you forgive met she asked after her recital i will never think of that again said and if i do it will be with gratitude that they have played their part in doing away with the one great sorrow of my life and bringing back the happiness of my youth the one great blessing that life holds for me i have come to take you home she said to ask you to come back if you will but forgive me she spoke humbly s face gave answer even before he could master himself to speak he stretched out his hand and drew her to him i am at home now wherever you are is my home when came out of his private office there was such a change in him that the clerks who had remained at the bank thought that he must have received some great aid from the lady who had been with him so long he had a few brief words with the explaining that he would be back at the bank before eight o clock in the morning and saying good night hurried to the door after mrs handing her into the carriage he ordered the coachman to drive home and springing in after her he closed the door behind him and they drove off meantime had not been idle after leaving mrs he drove straight to a agency for reconciliation the chief was in and was ushered into his private immediately he was a quiet looking stout man with a gray moustache and keen dark eyes he might have been a successful merchant or official but for the calmness of his manner and the low tones of his voice came immediately to the point i have a piece of important work on hand this evening he said of a private and delicate nature the s look was could i get i think so stated his case at the mention of s name a slight the very across the s calm face could not tell whether it was mere surprise or whether it was gratification now you see precisely what i wish he said as he finished stating the case and his plan it may not be necessary for him even to appear but i wish him to be on hand in case i should need his service if does not to my demand i shall arrest him for the fraud i have mentioned if he does i wish to accompany him to the boat of the south american line that sails to morrow morning and not leave him until the pilot comes oflf i do not apprehend that he will refuse when he knows the hand that i hold no he will not he knows what would happen if proceedings were started said the excuse me a moment he walked out of the office closing the door behind him and a few minutes later returned with david mr this is mr john i have explained to him the nature of the service you require of him he looked at mr who simply nodded his acquiescence you will take your orders from mr should anything arise to change his plans and act accordingly i know him said amused at the cool professional air with which his old friend greeted him in the presence of his principal simply but his eyes had a fire in them it was arranged that should to the place he had mentioned and order a supper there while should get the ticket at the oâ and then follow him so when had completed his he found at supper at a table near the ladies entrance a view of which he commanded in a mirror just before him mr s manner had entirely changed he was a man of the world and a host as he handed to his seat a supper for two has been ordered in private for he said in an as the waiter moved off they do not know whether it is for a gentleman and a lady or two gentlemen but i suppose it is for a lady as he has been here a number of times with ladies if you are sure that the lady will not come you might wait for him there i will remain here until he comes and follow him up in case you need me feared that the waiter might mention his presence ob no he knows us said with a faint smile at the bare suggestion mr called the head waiter and spoke to him in an the waiter himself showed up to the room where he found a table set with two covers the champagne cooler filled with ice was already on the floor beside the table looked at it grimly the curtains of the window were down and walked over to see on what street the window looked it was a deep the shade was drawn down and he raised it to find that the window faced on a dead wall at the moment the door opened and he heard s voice no one has come yet no sir not as i knows of stammered the waiter i have just come on where is the man who usually waits on met demanded half angrily est ii est well take this he said and remember that if yon serve me properly there will be a good deal more to follow the waiter thanked him now get down and be on the and when a lady comes and asks for show her up immediately if she asks who is here tell her two gentlemen and a lady you understand the waiter ,1
organs â wood roots bark most of the trees die of disease thus the magnificent silver are devoured by and comparatively few of them live to see their three birth year but nothing hurts the big tree i never saw one that was sick or showed the slightest sign of decay it lives on through indefinite thousands of years until burned blown down or shattered by some tremendous lightning stroke no bolt ever seriously hurts in all my walks i have seen only one that was thus killed outright lightning rare in the is common on the almost every day in june and july small refresh the main forest belt clouds like snowy â oâ n â â of bâ â w r the calm sky about midday and cast shadows and showers that seldom last more than an hour nevertheless these brief kind storms wound or kill a good many trees i have seen silver two hundred feet high split into long rails and down to the roots leaving not even a stump the rails like the of a wheel from a hole in the ground where the tree stood but the instead of being split and usually has forty or the fifty feet of its top smashed off in short about the size of cord wood the beautiful rosy red ruins covering the ground in a circle a hundred feet wide or more i never saw any that had been cut down to the ground or even to below the branches except one in the grove about twelve feet in the greater part of which was smashed to f rag ments leaving only a stump about seventy five feet high it is a curious fact that all the very old have lost their heads by lightning all things come to him who waits but of all living things is perhaps the only one able to wait long enough to make sure of being struck by lightning thousands of years it stands ready and waiting offering its head to every passing cloud as if inviting its fate praying for heaven s fire as a blessing and when at last the old head is off another of the same shape immediately begins to grow on every bud and branch seems excited like bees that have lost their queen and tries hard to repair the e branches that for many centuries have ward and all their arrange themselves with reference to a new top of the same peculiar curve as the old one even the small subordinate branches down the trunk do their best to push up to the top and help in this curious head making our national the great age of these noble trees is even more wonderful than their huge size standing bravely np in out to all that fortune may bring them triumphant over tempest and fire and time fruitful and beautiful giving food and shelter to multitudes of small fleeting creatures dependent on their other trees may claim to be about as large or as old english and venerable trees of renown some of which are from ten to thirty feet in we read of oaks that are supposed to have existed ever since the creation but strange to say i can find no definite accounts of the age of any of these trees but only based on tradition and assumed average of growth no other known tree approaches the in grandeur height and thickness being considered and none as far as i know has looked down on so many centuries or opens such impressive and suggestive views into history the majestic monument of the kings river forest is as we have seen fully four thousand years old and measuring the rings of growth we find it was no less than twenty seven feet in at the beginning of the christian era while many observations lead me to expect the discovery of others ten or twenty centuries older as to those of moderate age there are thousands mere youths as yet that â the s w the light that shone on s uplifted on many a royal gilded throne and deed forgotten in the present saw the age of trees and groves and mystic and saw from forest like these the bring his arches great trees and groves used to be as sacred monuments and halls of council and worship but soon after the discovery of the grove one of the trees was cut down for the sake of a stump the laborious had seen the biggest tree in the world they must try to see the biggest stump and dance on it the growth in height for the first two centuries is usually at the rate of eight to ten inches a year of course all very large trees are old but those equal in size may vary greatly in age on account of variations in soil or of growth etc thus a tree about ten feet in that grew on the side of a meadow was according to my own count of the only two hundred and fifty nine years old at the time it was while another in the same grove of almost exactly the same size but less situated was fourteen hundred and forty years old the tree cut for a dance floor was twenty four feet in and only thirteen hundred years old another about the same size was a thousand years older i our national the following notes and are copied from my â age s

less as proceeds and progress may be so with some degree of accuracy the position and form of the heart is described by some as typical in cases of but variations are too common we think to admit of a type the shadow is doubtless in the majority of cases smaller and more than usual but how much of this change in size is due to is not defined a small sized heart is said to to whilst a large heart a more hopeful this is an interesting point but one requiring considerable before statements can be accepted upon it in the are usually clearly by x rays if air filled they present a clear area

read to thee honest have in all probability awakened thy curiosity to know further particulars concerning the manners of the who hold me in was lately at one of their public ceremonies which at first perplexed me exceedingly as to its object but as the explanations of a friend have let me of esq somewhat into the secret and as it seems to bear no small to thy profession a description of it may contribute to thy amusement if not to thy instruction a few days since just as i had finished ray coffee and was my whiskers preparatory to a morning walk i was waited upon by an of this place a gay young who has of late cultivated my acquaintance he presented me with a square bit of painted which he informed me would me to to the city assembly curious to know the meaning of a phrase which was entirely new to me i requested an explanation when my friend informed me that the assembly was a numerous of young people of both sexes who on certain occasions gathered together to dance about a large room with violent and try to out dress each other â in short said he â if you wish to see the natives in all their glory there s no place like the city assembly so you must go there and sport your whiskers â though the matter of sporting my whiskers was considerably above my apprehension yet now began as i thought o whim and opinions to understand him had heard of the of the natives which are a kind of religious institution and had little doubt but that this must be a solemnity of the kind anxious as i am to contemplate this strange people in every situation i willingly to his proposal and to be the more at ease i determined to lay aside my dress and appear in plain garments of the fashion of this country as is my custom whenever i wish to mingle in a crowd without exciting the attention of the gaping multitude it was long after the shades of night had fallen before my friend appeared to conduct me to the assembly â thought i a themselves in mystery and seek the aid of gloom and darkness to the solemnity of their pious â to conduct myself with that decent respect which every stranger owes to the customs of the land in which he i my feat into an expression of sober reverence and stretched my face into a degree of suitable to the ceremony i was about to witness spite of myself i felt an emotion of awe stealing over of esq a l my senses as i approached the majestic pile my imagination pictured something similar to a descent into the cave of daniel where the of the east are taught their arts entered with the same gravity of that i would have approached the holy temple of and bowed my head three times as i passed the threshold â a head of the mighty â thought i on being ushered into a splendid saloon â what a display is here surely i am transported to the of the tjie of the faithful â â how tame appeared all the descriptions of enchanted palaces in our poetry wherever i turned my eyes the quick glances of beauty dazzled my vision and my heart lovely fluttered by me darting imperial looks of conquest or beaming such smiles of invitation as did when he beckoned our holy prophet to heaven shall i own the weakness of thy friend good â while thus gazing on the enchanted scene before me i for a moment forgot my country and even tl e memory of my three and twenty wives faded from my heart my thoughts were i whim and opinions bewildered and led astray by the charms of these savages and i sunk for a while into that delicious state of mind where the senses all enchanted and all striving for mastery produce an endless variety of tumultuous yet pleasing emotions oh never shall i again wonder that an should prove a to the single solitary wife allotted him when even thy friend armed with all the of can so easily prove to three and twenty â whither have you led me â said i at length to my companion â and to whom do these beautiful creatures belong certainly this must be the of the grand of the city and a most happy must he be to possess treasures which even his of cannot parallel â have a care â cried my companion â how you talk about or you ll have all these gentle about your ears for is a word which beyond all others they â most of them â â continued he â have no lord and master but come here to catch one â they re in the market as we term it â â ah ha â said i of esq â then you really have a fair or slave market such as we have in the east where the faithful are provided with the of and â by our glorious sun of but i should like to select some ten or a dozen wives from so lovely an pray what do you suppose they might be bought for â before i could receive an answer my attention was attracted by two or three good looking middle sized men who being dressed in a colour universally worn in this country by the and i concluded to be high priests and was confirmed in my original opinion that this was a religious ceremony these reverend personages are entitled and enjoy unlimited authority in the being armed with

a horse robinson pretty good rule horse shoe all the world through but come here is supper draw up mr butler mary having completed the arrangement of the board whilst this conversation was in progress the family now sat down to their it was during the meal that mary was very attentive in the discharge of the offices of the table and especially when they were required by butler there was a modest and natural courtesy in her that attracted the notice of our soldier and the kindly impression which the girl had made upon him and it was accordingly with a feeling composed in one degree of curiosity to learn more of her character and in another of that sort of tenderness which an open hearted man is apt to entertain towards an and pretty female that he took occasion after supper when mary had seated herself on the threshold of the porch to fall into conversation with her you do not live here i think i have gathered but are only on a visit was the remark addressed to the maiden no sir it is thirty good long miles by the shortest road from this to my father s house mistress is my mother s sister and that makes her my aunt you know sir and your father s name he has a mill sir on the you are the miller s daughter then well that s a pretty title i suppose they call you so the men sometimes call me replied mary rising to her feet and leaning carelessly against one of the upright that supported the porch the miller s pretty daughter but the women call me plain mary faith my dear the men come nearer to the truth than the women they say not replied the maiden i have heard and sometimes i have read in good at least they called them good books â that you mustn t believe the men and why should you not i don t well know why not returned the girl but i am young and maybe i shall find it out by and by god forbid said butler that you should ever gain that ex horse shoe robinson but there are many toils spread for the feet of innocence in this world and it is well to have a discreet eye and good friends i am seventeen sir replied mary come next month and though i have travelled backwards and forwards from here to and once to which you know sir is a good deal of this world to see i never knew anybody that thought harm of me but i don t dispute there are men to be afraid of and some that nobody could like and yet i think a good man can be told by his face are you sure of that yes my father is a good man and every one says you may see it in his looks i should like to know your father said butler i am sure he would be glad to know you sir now my pretty miller s daughter why do you think so because you are a gentleman replied the girl for all your clothes ha pray how have you found that out you talk differently from our people sir your words or your voice i can t rightly tell which are softer than i have been used to hear and you don t look and walk and behave as if had been all you ever wore and is that all you stop to consider as if you were studying what would please other people and you do not step so heavy sir and you do not swear and you do not seem to like to give trouble i can t think sir that you have been always used to such as are and then there s another reason sir added the maiden almost in a whisper what is that asked butler smiling why sir when you stooped down to pick up your fork that fell from the table i saw a blue ribbon round your neck and a beautiful gold picture hanging to it none but gentlemen of quality carry such things about them and as there is so much and bloody doings going on about here i was sure you wasn t what you seemed w for heaven s sake my dear exclaimed butler startled by horse shoe h the disclosure of the maiden s suspicion which was so naturally accounted for keep this to yourself and the time may come when i shall be able to reward your fidelity if you have any good will towards me as i hope you have tell nobody what you have seen never fear me sir returned the maid i wouldn t let on to any one in the house for the world i am for general washington and the which is more than i think the people here are indeed muttered butler thoughtfully and scarce above his breath what side does your father take mary my father is an old man sir and he reads his bible and every night before we go to bed he aloud before us all i mean all that belong to his house for quiet once more and peace his petition is that there may be an end of strife and that the sword and spear may be turned into the hook and â you know the words sir perhaps for they are in the good book and so he doesn t take any side but then the english officers are not far oft and take his house and use it as they please so that he has no mind of his own and almost all the people round us are and we are afraid of our lives if we do not say whatever they say alas that s the misfortune of many more than your father s household but how comes ,10
matter at what sacrifice of money or honor he must possess this sweetest ornament of womanhood everything convinced him that his progress was sure if slow mrs regarded him as a friend his presence at her apartments was always welcome he was confidential with her almost to the degree of familiarity she had confessed that her marriage was not happy she had implied at least that she loved another and who could that other be but himself brought up with the idea of the laws of society must be brought into her mind with the greatest care during the very hours that mr was meeting his love and his child in cambridge quite a different scene was being at the flat in boston mr was making one of his afternoon calls and was using every effort to bring his long quest to a close you are sad again to day said to him when he had been in the house half an hour and had replied in to all her suggestions there is no happiness in store for me was his reply i am doomed misery not only have i my own to bear but one i love is being deceived in the most cruel manner and there is nothing i dare do to aid her she studied the statement for some seconds and then asked him to explain what good will it do he demanded no one the bearer of evil tidings supposing i should their marriage bond tell a woman that her husband was a robber and a murderer she might leave him but she would always associate me with her injury a robber and a murderer that certainly could not refer to i never could understand said with a that made her look why don t you speak out plainly if you know anything that you ought to tell me fear nothing i hope i am sensible enough not to connect a friend who brings unpleasant news with the news itself he regarded her so intently that she flushed before his gaze shall i he asked i ought to tell you but is it wise he took a from the pocket of his coat and held it thoughtfully in his hands then he slowly it and exhibited two pieces of glass on which fragments of a torn letter were in such a manner that both sides could be easily read no he exclaimed as if strongly moved it is better that you do not read it had seen at a glance that the writing was that of her husband and her curiosity was aroused to the utmost as mr had expected she sprang to his and endeavored to take the article from him while he was in the pretended act of returning it to his pocket there was a pretty little struggle and then as if out of pure gallantry he surrendered and the panes of glass were in her hands it is cruel he said with well emotion i cannot justify myself for letting you see this but after all the fault is his i will resist no more lay it their marriage bond on the table and see what your friend and mine is capable of doing with shaking fingers she did as suggested mr assisted by laying the pieces in their proper order and turning the pages when she had read to the foot of each with heart the young wife read the lines which showed that her husband had a real true affection for another woman that the marriage bond which bound him to one he could never love were all that kept him from his life to her and mr having played his great card watched the effect with eyes which he had to sympathetic grief for her outraged feelings my dear girl he said in a low tone when she had reached the end for the second time each word having been re i am so sorry for you but after all it was my duty to bring you this could anything be more heartless than his conduct nothing said hard and putting her hand blindly to her forehead how did you come in possession of this he told her a carefully prepared story how he had met miss rivers at the home of his friend in how a servant the signature to the letter had picked it out of a waste basket and handed it to him as a joke on mr and how he had been shocked by the which its contents represented i thought at first that i would show him what i had learned added and demand that he a double existence that is a crime to you and a shame to humanity but his letter showed that the right alternative that of giving up this woman is too improbable to be hoped for the language he uses in that note a perfect then i reflected that no their marriage bond one can ever tell what a woman will do that perhaps you would rather retain him though he be than to have your name in the divorce column that i had no right to interfere with your affairs without putting you in possession of all the facts and i brought the letter here to day doubtful if i should find courage to exhibit it fearful lest the good turn i wanted to do you might be and cause me to fall in the esteem of one whose high opinion i value above everything she sat listening with the air of one from whom all bodily strength had vanished the blow had been very hard for her we shall have to separate and i she said thoughtfully but your mother he asked significantly i cannot consider her altogether said calmly for her i made the error of my life she has seen her mistake and i do not think she will try to my feelings again if ,5
from river to river as well as a thousand things i should never have expected would enter the head of such a child it was very seldom to put it fairly that her father and i touched any subject on which she had not a considerable stock of information and where she did not understand she was ready with her anxious to let no opportunity escape to inform herself two hours passed in this way to my great entertainment when the clock struck ten mr asked if she would not like to show mr her upon which the child and herself in the most charming manner went to fetch them i exclaimed as soon as she was out of out of hearing has she kept the of her child hood till now her childhood echoed with a start her childhood why she is in the very fruit and flower of it did you think childhood ended when a girl reached her cares for her as much as she did five years ago in fact i think she grows of them every day this statement filled me with intense surprise i had been noting this girl s remarkable stock of knowledge and had come to consider her a of learning she had carried herself in our company with all the ease of ten additional years retaining still the gentleness and grace of her extreme youth but how could i conceive that the mind which had been devoted for the previous quarter hour to the triple alliance and the russian understanding would turn with equal interest to the of papa said the young voice as its owner reappeared at the door don t you think as there are so many mr had better come and see them in their own quarters mr and i complied with the suggestion and a moment later we were in a room such as i certainly had never seen before though no doubt there are others somewhat like it the furniture with the exception of several larger chairs was of a pattern and consisted of beds etc of a size to fit the occupants which were at least fifty in number it was in short the most complete nursery you could imagine and you still play with them i could not help the tragedy of my life saying for the fact was incomprehensible in view of what else i had seen and heard u of course i do laughed the fresh young voice i spend two hours here every day it is the greatest fun i have names for them all and their histories are written down in this book showing me a large like volume and i have in this little chest when they are sick and each has her summer clothes as well as winter ones as you can see by examining this closet i think they are the sweetest things in the world except except the child hesitated several seconds real truly babies had a wistful expression as she said this that i shall never forget it was a look like that of a starving child who spoke of food quite a nurse isn t she said mr gazing fondly at his offspring and she is just as capable of taking care of living children as of these we feel the same way about it and i you ought to be here some time when we have one of our infant parties half the babies in the neighborhood and puts them around the floor here each with a toy to keep it quiet and we have the most delightful time i asked her once what she wanted to be when she grew up we were speaking of professions and she said a mother the little daughter nodded assent to the statement i do envy the mothers so she cried not attempting to conceal her enthusiasm sometimes when i have carried all my babies home i sit down i out of and cry even my dear do not seem the same to me after that returning to the in their and beds she took them up one by one and introduced them to me with great solemnity giving the names of each along with bits of personal gossip which is the eldest i asked to show my interest though my mind was wandering far from the subject under consideration why the largest of course she laughed taking up a doll half as big as herself declared that the joke was on me that time then he said good night to his daughter who took my hand again in the same frank way she had grasped it when introduced and we were left alone there ought to be a baby in this house for to play with i said as i stood a few moments later with my overcoat on in the front hall my host staggered as if about to faint and his face you have touched upon the tragedy of my life my friend he said in a very low tone some day i mean to tell you its history i wanted to say something in the nature of an apology but could not exactly frame the expressions it was evident however that he did not feel the need of anything of the kind for he said in a kindly voice as i stepped out into tho snow laden air housekeeping under difficulties chapter iii housekeeping under difficulties when i thought over the events of that evening there were several things that i noted particularly mr had but one member of his family upon whom he his affection that one was equally in her love neither of them had alluded in the remotest manner to a wife or a mother mrs who certainly existed and who as certainly was an of that residence had not made her appearance during my call and then there was the strange remark of my friend as i was ,5

days but will he return to again this beautiful mould joseph asked and striving against the doubt that the sight of the dead put into his mind he left the tomb with the intention of rolling the stone into the door better not to see him than to doubt him he said but who will he asked himself roll away the stone for and mary when they come with and fine linen for the his mind was divided whether he should close the tomb and go his way or watch through the sabbath and while seeking to come upon a resolve he was overcome by desire to see his dead friend once more and he entered the tomb holding high the lantern so that the brook he might better see him but as he approached the couch on which the body lay he stopped and the colour went out of his face he trembled all over for the sheet with which and mary covered over the face had fallen away and a long of hair had dropped across the cheek he must have moved or angels must have moved him and uncertain whether was alive or dead joseph remembered and stood watching cold and frightened waiting for some movement he is not dead he is not dead he cried and his joy died for on the instant passed again into the darkness of joseph had no water to his forehead with nor even a drop to wet his lips with there is none nearer than my house he said i shall have to carry him thither but if a meets us the news that a man newly risen from the tomb was seen on the with another will soon reach and the will send soldiers the tomb will be the houses in the neighbourhood will be searched why then did he awaken only to be taken again lay as still as the dead and hope came again to joseph on a sabbath evening he said i shall be able to carry him to my house secretly the distance is about half a mile but to carry a man half a mile up a crooked and steep path among rocks will take all my strength he took of his and and feeling them to be strong and like iron he said i can do it and fell to thinking of his servants in the passages talking as they ascended the stairs stopping half way and talking again and getting to bed slowly more slowly than ever on this night the night of all others that he wished them sound asleep in their beds half a mile up a path i shall have to carry him he may die in my arms and he entertained the thought for a moment that he might go for his servants who would bring with them oil and wine but the brook the thought as unwise he left the tomb to see if the darkness were thick enough to shelter himself and his burden but might pass away in his if he had some water to give him but he had none and he sat by the couch waiting for to open his eyes at last he opened them the twilight had vanished and the stars were coming out and joseph said to himself there will be no moon only a soft and he stood gazing at the desert showing through a great tide of blue shadow the shape of the hills emerging like the of great ships afloat in a shadowy sea a dark close dusty night he said and deserted by every man and woman a sabbath night on none other would it be possible but thinking that some hours would have to pass before he dared to enter his gates with on his shoulder he seated himself on the great stone though were to die for lack of he must wait till his servants were in bed asleep and then the stone on which he was sitting must be rolled into the entrance of the tomb before leaving he had told the that he would have no trouble with it and to discover that he had not boasted he slid down the rock and putting his shoulder to it found he could move it for the ground was and if he were to remove some the stone would itself roll into the entrance of the tomb but he hadn t known this when he refused the s help then why to pass away the time he fell to thinking that he had refused the s aid because of some thought of which he wasn t very conscious at the time that he had been appointed and that his watch extended through the night and through the next day and night until mary and came with and linen the of his thoughts was brought to a close and with a sudden jerk by some memory of his maybe dying the brook friend and in his grief he found no better solace than to gaze at the stars now thickly sown in the sky and to attempt to their and trying to pick out a prophecy in heaven of what was happening on earth his star gazing was interrupted suddenly by a bark a he said other answered the first bark the seemed to be filled with them but however numerous he could scare them away a wandering a dead body would be more dangerous for he was but it was seldom that one ventured into the of the city and he listened to the and they kept him awake till something in the air told him the hour had come for him to go into the tomb and carry out of it if he were not dead he slid down from the rock again and no sooner did he reach the ground than he remembered having left to keep his promise to his father ,3

on her clergy the very existence of the church as a steadfast power above the multitude giving law to the people and not receiving its law day by day from them depends on its maintenance and if we are

well being it will be secured to us through the of the very reform i advocate â a reform which shall render the clergyman independent of his and enable him to say to all you may cease to pay but i shall not cease to preach so long as you have sins to and i have strength to them i live in good part by the labor of my hands and can do so wholly whenever that shall become necessary to the fearless discharge of my duty a single illustration more and i draw this long to a close i shall speak now more directly to facts within my own knowledge and which have made on me a deep and mournful

brave youth who have nearly or quite exhausted their little means in what is termed an education and must now find some employment to sustain them while they are more specially fitting b ui hints toward for and themselves into a profession some of find and are contented with some but the great body of them turn their attention at once to literature â to the instruction of their in some school or family or to the instruction of the world through the press hundreds of them hurry at once to the cities and the journals seeking employment as or of intelligence â bright visions of fame in the and the gaunt wolf famine hard at their heels alas for them they do not see that the very circumstances under which they seek admission to the calling they have chosen almost forbid the idea of their succeeding in it they do not approach the public with thoughts struggling for utterance but with craving bread they seek the press not that they may proclaim through it what it would cost their lives to repress but that they may preserve their souls to their bodies at some rate do you not see under what immense one of this band enters upon his selected if he has the rare fortune to find or make a place in it he is surrounded on every side by anxious hundreds eager to obtain employment on any terms he must write not what he feels but what another needs must regret or rejoice to order working for the day and not venturing to utter a thought which the day does not readily approve and can you fancy that is the foundation on which to build a lofty and renown â a brave and success of any kind

to live on two shillings and so preserve your mental faculties fresh and to read to observe to think thus preparing yourself for the ultimate path you have chosen at length when a mind crowded with discovered or truths will have utterance begin to write and for the nearest suitable â no matter how humble and obscure â if the thought is in you it will find its way to those who need it seek not compensation for this utterance until compensation shall seek you then accept it if an object and not too great sacrifices of independence and disregard of more immediate duties in this way can something like the proper dignity of the literary character be restored and maintained but while every man who either is or believes himself capable of others appears only anxious to sell his faculty at the earliest moment and for the largest price i can not hope that the public will be induced to regard very profoundly either the lesson or the teacher students of college a parting word with you some of you have completed your studies and are now passing out into the actual world to be followed in successive years by your brethren whom you now leave behind you i will not doubt that you bid adieu to these scenes with lofty purposes of usefulness â with a proper appreciation of the advantages over the great mass of your countrymen which have been here you and of the obligations which these advantages draw after them am not so far removed from youth as to have forgotten all its sanguine visions and generous aspirations i you cherish them each and all for they are wiser than the cold lesson which disappointment and experienced treachery may tf hints toward afterward teach you o be assured above all things that no generous and self forgetting can ever be unwise or mistaken

day and night they did not object however to my speaking occasionally to the lady and to the servant maid to the latter i said under my breath i shall escape impossible returned she in the same manner do not attempt it you will only be i laugh at i replied i have worn them so long already i then bade her presently gossip with the guards she complied with and while they were i rushed out never looking behind me i took at once the open country and made for the coast leaping over two or three streams the very first of which probably brought the to a pause then i ran across fields and through woods and after three hours of sharp s pace arrived here expecting to find a vessel we had engaged lying off the coast instead of which a government ship watches the harbour and is evidently on the watch for us nothing remains therefore for me but to double like a hare and take to the hills they are doubtless looking out for you said but sleep â sleep peacefully i will watch beside you as if you

moved and said how shall i ever you t you will wake me on the first alarm v rely on me thank you said and the next minute he was asleep it was still bright when they were up and away and over the hills who knew every path led the way but his companion kept closely up with him and when after an hour s hard walking they reached a solitary tract where they could draw breath conversed with his generous guide as friend with friend and told him his personal history it was a sad tale of wrongs and injustice of false and and burning and unworthy escapes and unexpected one thing was too evident if false had found innocent and truthful they had not left him so his mind was and by the poisonous moral atmosphere he had been compelled to breathe but yet he had not lost all his original nobility his love of his country was touching his sentiments original and often fine he had been high in command had held offices of trust and been the stern opponent of and when dared no longer proceed with him they embraced like brothers and he wistfully watched him out of sight chapter v the old country house his steps the greater part of the way he was so in thoughts on what had recently happened as to be insensible to the of the distance at length he struck into a lane between high banks which presently descended into a fertile valley by a very road which led to an old country mansion at t iq of this mansion stood a dusty travelling carriage surrounded by a small knot of people which instantly filled with surprise and excitement and made him his walk into a run here he comes cried one of the group who hastening towards him exclaimed the has arrived my sister cried how delightful a i surprise and hurrying in doors he sprang up the marble stairs clearing three of the shallow steps at a time and entered the di a large lofty apartment with on the doors and a ceiling where three or four persons were talking all together with the greatest glee ah here is cried the old gentleman of the house on which a young lady in a travelling dress ran to welcome him what what exclamations there was a baby boy also to be introduced and admired i am lost in wonder said who would have thought of seeing you dearest v nobody can be more surprised than myself said it is all owing to s kindness he has lately been â oh i cannot describe to you how good happening to say one day lately what pleasure and delight it would give me to see you all again he said quite quietly and why should you not v i never was more surprised can you really be in earnest â said i certainly said he i always mean what i say so then he told me how it might all be arranged as nicely as possible and said that as doctor and his wife were starting for the he would me to the care of and the rest of the way he will come and

not much mistaken something of the same kind is to be found in the history of for many years it was completely repressed by the of english genius but are we to suppose that during thai period the seeds were not in secret operation from which that harvest of glory has since sprung which has now fairly placed us on a level with the sister kingdom there were then doubtless many scholars among us

his face showed the change produced by the slow of poison every that the words contained had reached its mark but felt that their obvious intent was lost in the anguish of what they suggested he was sure now that would never have betrayed him but the only made a wider outlet for his anger he paused for to speak if she knows it s not through me it was what had waited for through you by god who said it was through you do you suppose i leave it to you or to anybody else for that matter to keep my wife informed of my actions i didn t suppose even such the touch of conceit as yours could a man to that degree struggling for a in the of his dignity he added in a tone my wife learned the facts from me received this in silence the other s outbreak seemed to have restored his self control and when he spoke it was with a deliberation that his course was chosen in that case i understand still less still less v the meaning of this he pointed to the when you began to speak i supposed you had meant it as a bribe now i can only infer it was intended as a random insult in either case here s my answer he tore the slip of paper in two and tossed the fragments across the desk to then he turned and walked out of the office dropped his head on his hand if he had hoped to restore his a vanished hand self respect by the simple expedient of the result had not justified his expectation the blow he had struck had the edge of his anger and the extent of the hurt inflicted did not alter the fact that his weapon had broken in his hands he now saw that his rage against was only the last of a passionate self disgust this consciousness did not dull his dislike of the man it simply made ineffectual to quarrel with him was the last stage of his in the light of this final humiliation his assumption of his wife s struck him as hardly so as the sentimental of his past he had been living in a world wherein his emotions were the of his vanity and it was with instinctive relief that he felt its ruins crash about his head it was nearly dark when he l ft his the touch of office and he walked slowly homeward in the complete mental that follows on such a crisis he was not aware that he was thinking of his wife yet when he reached his own door he found that in the involuntary of his vision she had once more become the central point of a vanished hand xiii it had never before occurred to him that might after all have missed the purport of the document he had put in her way what if in her hurried inspection of the papers she had passed it over as related to the private business of some what for instance was to prevent her concluding that was the counsel of the unknown person who had sold the letters the subject was one not likely to fix her attention â she was not a curious woman at this point laid down his fork and glanced at her between the candle shades the alternative explanation of her indifference was not slow in presenting itself her head had the same listening as when he had caught the touch of sight of her the day before in s company the attitude revived the of his impression it was simple enough after all she had ceased to care for him because she cared for some one else as he followed her upstairs he felt a sudden stirring of his anger his sentiments had lost their artificial he had already her of any in his and he felt only that he loved her and that she had escaped him this was now strangely enough his dominant thought the sense that he and she had passed through the of love and had emerged from it as apart as though the had never taken place every other passion he mused left some mark upon the nature but love passed like the flight of a ship across the waters she dropped into her usual seat near the lamp and he leaned against the a vanished hand chimney moving about with an hand the on the mantel suddenly he caught sight of her reflection in the mirror she was looking at him he turned and their eyes met he moved across the room there s something that i want to say to you he began she held his gaze but her colour deepened he noticed again with a jealous pang how her beauty had gained in warmth and meaning it was as though a transparent cup had been filled with wine he looked at her i ve never prevented you seeing your friends here he broke out why do you meet in out of the way places nothing makes a woman so cheap she rose abruptly and they faced each other a few feet apart what do you mean she asked i saw you with him last sunday on the drive he went on the the touch of utterance of the charge his anger ah i she murmured she sank into her chair again and began to play with a paper knife that lay on the table at her elbow her silence exasperated him well he burst out is that all you have to say do you wish me to explain she asked proudly do you imply i haven t the right to v i imply nothing i will tell you whatever you wish to know i went for a walk with mr because he asked me to i didn t suppose you went but there are certain ,11

have cost her ten or twelve shillings at the least she was delighted to hear from me she had been ill but was better now and the concluded with the usual am writing the letter that arrived two days afterwards was like herself full of impulse and affection but it contained one phrase which put black into my heart in her description of her illness and her health which was returning and how she had come to be staying in this far away southern town she alluded to its saying that if i came there virtue must be its own reward stupid of her to speak to me of virtue i muttered for she must know well enough that it was her partial virtue that had separated us and caused this long and i sat pondering trying to discover if she applied the phrase to herself or to the place where she was staying the lovers op how could it apply to the place all places would be a paradise if at the close of a december evening i wrote a letter the answer to which would decide whether i should go to her whether i should undertake the long journey the journey back will be detestable i muttered and taking up the pen again i wrote your letter contains a phrase which fills me with dismay you say virtue must be its own reward and this would seem that you are determined to be more than ever this is ill news indeed you would not have me consider it good news would you other letters followed but i doubt if i knew more of s intentions when i got into the train than i did when i sat pondering by my fireside trying to discover her meaning when she wrote that vile phrase virtue must be its own reward but somehow i seemed to have come to a decision and that was the main thing we act obeying a law deep down in our being a law which in normal circumstances we are not aware of i asked myself as i drove to the station if it were possible that i was going to undertake a journey of more than a thousand miles in quest â of what s pretty face it might be pretty no longer yet she could not have changed much she had said she was sure that in ten minutes we should be talking just as in old times even so none but travel a thousand miles in search of a pretty face and it was the madman that is in us all that was me or was it the primitive man who in some of our of my dead life being of one thing i was sure that i was no longer a conventional citizen of the nineteenth century i had gone back two or three thousand years for all characteristic traits everything whereby i knew myself had disappeared yet i seemed to have met myself somewhere in some book or poem or opera i could not remember at first but after some time i began to perceive a shadowy between myself and â dare i mention the names â the heroes of ancient legend â or â which both had gone a thousand miles on beauty s quest the colour of s hair isn t mentioned in either the or the s quest was a golden and so was mine and it was the primitive hero that i had discovered in myself that helped me to face the idea of the journey for there is nothing that me so much as a long journey in the train when i was twenty i started with the intention of long travel but the train journey from to paris wearied me so much that i had rested in paris for eight years to return home then on account of some financial during those eight years i thought often of italy and the south of france but the train journey of sixteen or seventeen or eighteen hours to the italian frontier always seemed so much like what must be that the heaven of italy on the other side never tempted me to undertake it a companion would be of no use one cannot talk for fifteen or sixteen hours and while with myself i should go to i often glanced down the lovers of the long perspective of hours everything and pain alike are greater in imagination than in reality â there is always a reaction and having anticipated more than mortal weariness i was surprised to find that the first two hours in the train passed very pleasantly it seemed that i had only been in the train quite a little while when it stopped yet is more than an hour from paris quite a station and it seems strange that the d should stop there that was the grand name of the train that i was travelling by think of any english company running a train and calling it the shore think of going to or to cross saying you are going by the shore so long as the name of this train it is impossible to doubt that the french mind is more picturesque than the english and one no longer wonders why the french school of painting etc a fruit was crying his wares along the platform and just before we started from breakfast was preparing on board the train i thought a basket of french grapes â the grapes that grow in the open air not the hot house grapes filled with of that we eat in england â would pass the time i got out and bought a basket from him on journeys like these one has to resort to many various little alas the grapes were only the bunch on the top was nor was that one worth eating and i began to think that the railway company s attention ,3

it but just to tell you what i feared ned will leave us and who knows but he may take another trip around the horn he will then throw himself into the great le for freedom in that become a general of h his across the and perhaps reaching th rights of will fall in some splendid battle having first engraved with his sword the name of the cold upon the ice of the and there he will leave that mighty mountain to tell posterity how burning was his love how frozen was his mistress now there s dignity and sentiment both for you let himself beat that if he can why what an are you cried i do not wonder that edward hazard should be so little serious with such a companion i then you do not like him on the contrary replied i like him exceedingly as well as a brother but depend upon it i cannot entertain him in any other relation until perhaps â he has learned to be more sentimental and scrupulous in his behavior interrupted her cousin at least said in a more serious manner and evidently as if she felt what she said until he ceases to jest upon me that s in confidence said i understand you the hawk ned some to go yet at all events he most not leave swallow barn if you are in earnest

the river and from thence homeward so much engrossed with the topics that had brought into discussion that gradually forgot her hawk and fell into a confidential communion upon a subject that was nearer to her feelings than she chose to confess the particulars of this further discourse which was continued until they had reached the house after our ar b at the was not all related to me by but made upon his mind was that ned hazard had not taken the pains to s favor which the value of the prize deserved he did not doubt that she had an affection for him but still she spoke as if there were prejudices to be overcome and scruples to be conquered which stood in the way of her decision s object under all his levity of manner was to ascertain whether ned s quest was hopeless or otherwise and he had therefore availed himself of the adventure of the hawk to draw her thoughts into the current indicated in the above conversation his conclusion firom it all was that ned must either reform his behavior towards or his pretensions added ned is falling rapidly into that privileged intimacy that is fatal to the pretensions of a lover this careless friendship will lodge him in a short time high and dry upon a in her regard where he will become a permanent and picturesque he will acquire the distinction of a brother as she begins to call him already and he will be certain to be invited to her wedding chapter the whilst and were still over the matters i haye imperfectly to my reader s attention in the last chapter ned the door of the study and came towards us with an animated step and a countenance full of merriment he told us with much of his own in the and of the value of his services that the old family which had been so tempest and weather beaten was at length happily into port that the apple pie was once more elevated to the rank of a frontier stream upon whose banks the hostile of the and the hazard might now in peace that after through a sea of manuscript to oblige mr and hearing many wise legal from his lips and turning s brain with points and merely to prevent him from the decision mr had succeeded in bringing the matter to a close and was now busy in drawing up a formal judgment upon the case continued ned is like to suffer injury from it is as much as he can do to prevent himself from bursting out into a horse laugh at every line he writes but he is i believe somewhat by mr who takes the whole matter as the aa if it were a state the best of it is is in doubt as to the propriety of the decision and with very little would bring in a verdict against the s whole endeavor for the last hour has therefore been to the case in such a manner as to keep from upon the inquiry whether the mill pond away in a series of years or was carried of by some violent accident now you know it is a fact of common that it was swept off in a tremendous flood finding likely to dwell on this circumstance has made a diversion upon a point of law that has happily the gentleman s scruples he says the act works no man injury and that if the dam has been ay suddenly it makes no difference because it would have away at any rate by this time and that it is extremely probable it was very much diminished before the flood that if therefore it was not an absolute it was a of that nature i think has written something of this sort in his report has so confounded as to set him to gazing at the ceiling in a brown study and has thrown mr into an ecstasy of admiration at s learning and all this time however mr has had his mouth up with repressed laughter which so

â not guilty in a full firm and mellow voice that drew the eyes of the spectators once more upon him and occasioned another slight hum of sympathy and admiration no change of colour was on his countenance nor any other expression save the lofty composure to which we have just alluded the of li na the trial at length proceeded and after a long and able statement from the attorney general was called upon the table the prisoner whose motions were keenly observed betrayed on seeing him neither embarrassment nor agitation all that could be perceived was a more earnest and intense light in his eyes as they settled upon his detailed with sin and accuracy the whole progress of the crime from its first conception to its indeed had he himself been in the dock and his evidence against a confession of his own guilt it would with some exceptions have been literally true he was cross examined but no tact or experience or talent on the part of the prisoner s counsel could in any important degree shake his testimony the ingenuity with which he laid and conducted the plot was astonishing as was his foresight and the precaution he adopted against detection o s attorney had out the very whom he purchased the box with a hope of proving that it was not the prisoner s property but his own yet this person who remembered the transaction very well assured that said he procured it by the desire of s bon during his whole evidence he once raised his eyes to look upon the prisoner s face until he was desired to identify him he then turned round and standing with the rod in his hand looked for some moments upon his victim his dark got black as night while his cheeks were to the hue of ashes the white smile as before sat upon his lips and his eyes in which there blazed the fire of a treacherous and cowardly heart sparkled with the red glare of triumph and vengeance he laid the rod upon s head and they gazed at each other face to face as striking a contrast as could be beheld the latter stood erect and his eye calmly bent upon that of his foe ut with a spirit in it that seemed to him the ki er or alone by it was best understood to strike dismay into the very soul of falsehood within him the villain s eyes could not stand the glance of s they fell and his whole countenance assumed such a blank and guilty stamp that an old experienced who watched them both could not avoid saying that if he had his will they should exchange situations i would not hang a dog he whispered on that low s evidence he in his face when asked why he ran away on meeting o s house on their return that night while c held his ground he replied that it was very natural he should run away and not wish to be seen after having assisted at such a crime in reply to another question he said it was as natural that should have run away also and that he could not account for it except by the fact that god always occasions the guilty jo commit some by which they may be brought to punishment these apparently so rational and satisfactory convinced s counsel that his case was hopeless and that no skill or ingenuity on heir part could in breaking down s evidence the next witness called was whose testimony s in every particular and gave t the whole trial a character of gloom and despair the who applied his shoes to the were then produced and swore in the manner as to their corresponding they then to finding the box in his pocket according to the information received from every of which they found to remarkably correct there was only one other witness now necessary to complete the chain against him and he was oi y produced because the maid positively stated and actually when previously examined that she was ignorant whether slept in hia father s house on the night in question or not thi re was no al the of therefore but to produce the father and was consequently forced to become an evidence against his own son the old man s appearance upon the table excited deep for both and the more so when the spectators contemplated the rooted sorrow which lay upon the wild and wasted features of the father still the old man was composed and calm but his calmness was in an extraordinary degree mournful and touching when he sat down after having been sworn and feebly wiped the dew from his thin temples many eyes were already filled with tears when die question was put to him if he remembered the night laid in the he replied that he did did the prisoner at the bar sleep at home on that night the old man looked into the face of the counsel with such an eye of entreaty as shook the voice in which the question was repeated he then turned about and taking a long gaze at his son rose up and extending his hands to the judge exclaimed my lord my lord he is my only son â my only child these words were by a pause in the business of the court and a dead silence of more than minute if justice said the judge could on any occasion her claim to a subordinate link in the testimony she requires it would certainly be in a case so painful and as this still we cannot permit personal feeling however amiable or attachment however strong to her progress when public

may be more valuable than a costly the married woman as soon as she takes upon herself the responsibility of standing at the head of an establishment should withdraw herself in a great measure from those little obligations and which as a young woman and unmarried she might with propriety have received she must therefore strictly avoid such especially from the great remembering that in being the mistress of a house she has herself become a source from whence kindness ought to flow and consequently is not so proper an object for receiving it to be just before we are generous is a good old the duties of benevolence must therefore always be made to those of integrity but still where a family is neither in debt nor in want of the common necessaries of life there must be something due from such a family to those who are more than themselves it is a privilege we all enjoy of being at liberty to choose our own way of being charitable yet if we think seriously on the subject of giving as a duty and regard our means as only lent to us for the purpose of doing the greatest possible amount of good which they are capable of we shall find that instead of its being the mere indulgence of a natural impulse to give it is often the study of a lifetime to learn how to give to judge by the of its practice one would suppose that one of the most approved methods of serving the poor was to give away at the door pieces of broken or otherwise objectionable food yet i am disposed to think that upon the whole more harm than good results from this practice for to say nothing of the temptation it offers to the poor to their own wants and sufferings the temptation to servants is no trifling one to be perpetually adding to the charitable what a little ingenuity or care might have converted into a wholesome or dish besides which it is impossible that any family should be able to furnish a regular supply of such food and the disappointment of the really destitute must be very great on those days when they are obliged to return home to set down to an empty table or perhaps to go to bed in addition to which objections we may safely add that the fewer and the wives op england about to be found at our doors the better those are seldom the most who ask assistance in this way and happily for our benevolence there are innumerable channels now open through which we may at least endeavor to do good with less probability of doing harm in the exercise of kindness to the poor care is often necessary to avoid into popular mistakes with regard to the merit of certain cases which after all frequently consists in nothing more than a few circumstances of interest to them the tide of fashion when it takes a charitable course will sometimes pour a perfect flood of benefits upon certain individuals to the neglect of others equally deserving and perhaps more in need but the mistress of a family whose mind is well governed will be her own judge in such matters and not allowing either or self indulgence to stand in her way nor even the task to others she will as far as it is possible to do so examine the case for herself in order that she may not be led away by the partial statements or highly colored representations of her friends for all the purposes of benevolence she will also keep a separate provision and separate accounts in order to ascertain at the end of the year or at any particular time what has been the exact proportion of her resources thus distributed without this kind of record we are apt sometimes to fancy we have been more generous than is really the case or on the other hand we may have been liberal beyond what was just for it is not the number of cases we relieve which has to be considered so much as the due proportion of our means which is bestowed upon charitable purposes when the duty of benevolence extended through offices of charity is considered in this light as being no duty in some cases and in others one of serious extent and responsibility and thus bearing through all the degrees between these two extremes exact reference to our pecuniary means to our situation in life and to the number of relative claims we have to fulfil it will easily be seen that to lay down any precise rules for the amount of money which ought to be expended in charity would be upon an extent of knowledge which no single individual can possess besides which there are so many ways of doing good that benevolent feeling can often find free exercise through channels which could scarcely be considered as belonging to what is generally understood by charity but while perfectly aware that little can be done in the way of our creatures without regard to their spiritual welfare i own i am one of those who would wish that the bodies as well as the of the poor might be cared for nor can i think they would be less likely to attend to instruction for being comfortably clothed and sufficiently fed the mistress of a family when truly benevolent will not rest satisfied with merely giving to the poor she will visit them in their dwellings make herself acquainted with their habits characters and circumstances and while urging upon them their religious duties or such means of religious instruction as may be within their reach her own experience in the practice of economy will enable her occasionally to throw in a few useful hints on the best method of their scanty means so as that every thing may be turned to ,7
it connected with the social of her calling and detailed some matters not generally known that may we trust be interesting to those who are fond of looking at the springs which often move rustic

a summer s day to be sure like all other irish villages it was remarkable for a of pigs and which being the stock in trade of cabin it is to be presumed that very few villages either tub irish in ireland or elsewhere could go on properly without them it consisted principally of one long street which you entered from the north west side by one of those old fashioned bridges the arches of which were much more akin to the than the most of the houses were of mud a few of stone one or two of which had the honour of being on the front side of the roof and on the back where was not necessary there were two or three shops a liberal of public houses a chapel a little out of the town and an old market house near the centre a few little bye streets projected in a direction from the main one which was terminated on the side opposite to the north west by a pound through which as usual ran a shallow stream that was gathered into a little as it crossed the road a crazy mill all covered and with grey dust stood about two hundred yards out of the town to which two straggling rows of houses that looked like an street led you this mill was surrounded by a green common which was again hemmed in by a fine river that ran round in a line from under the arch of the bridge we mentioned at the beginning now a little behind or rather al v this mill on the skirt of the common stood a rather neat looking cabin with about half a of garden behind it it was but small and consisted merely of a sleeping room and kitchen on one side of the door was a window opening on hinges and on the outside to the right as you entered the house there was placed a large stone about four feet high backed by a sloping mound of earth so as to allow a person to ascend the stone without any difficulty in this cabin moan the and we need scarcely inform our readers that the stone in question was her mounting stone by which she was enabled to place on a or as the case happened when called out upon her usual u

in the parish now but maybe he is on his way here and he may be here to morrow or the next day and when s father heard her speak like that he knew that no one would turn her from what she was sayings and he said michael my good man you may go your way you ll never get her then he went back to hear what was saying to the priest but it was the priest that was talking do you think says he i am going to let you go on turning the head of every boy in the parish do you think says he i m going to see you with one and then with the other do think i m going to see fighting and quarrelling for your like do you think i m going to hear stories like i heard last week about poor who has gone out of his mind they say on account of your treatment no says he i ll have no more of that i ll have you out of my parish or have you married didn t answer the priest she tossed her head and went on making up of tea and sugar and getting the steps and taking down candles though she didn t want them just to show the priest that she didn t mind what he was saying and all the while her father not knowing what would happen for the priest had a big and there was no saying that he wouldn t strike her tried to quiet the priest he promising him that shouldn t go out any more in the evenings and sir she was out the same evening with a young man and the priest saw them and the next evening she was out with another and the priest saw them nor was she minded at the end of the month to marry any of them then the priest went down to the shop to speak to her a second time and he went down again a third time though what he said the third time no one knows no one being there at the time and next sunday he spoke out saying that a daughter would have the worst devil in hell to attend on her i ve heard tell that he called her the evil spirit that set men mad but most of the people that were there are dead or gone to america and no one rightly knows what he did say only that the words came pouring out of his and the people when they saw crossed themselves and even the boys who were most mad after were afraid to speak to her had to put her out do you mean to say that the father put his daughter out sure didn t the priest threaten to turn him into a rabbit if he didn t and no one in the parish would speak to they were so afraid of father and if it hadn t been for the blind woman that i was speaking about a while ago sir it is to the she d have to go the blind woman has a little cabin at the edge of the â i ll point it out to you sir we do be passing it by â and she was with the blind woman for nearly two years by her own father her clothes wore out but she was as beautiful without them as with them the boys were told not to look back but sure they couldn t help it ah it was a long while before father could get shut of her the blind woman said she wouldn t see thrown out on the roadside and she was as good as her word for two years till went to america so some do be sayings sir whilst others do be saying she joined the but tis for sure sir that the day she left the parish pat heard a at his window and somebody asking if he would lend his cart to go to the railway station pat was a heavy and be didn t get np and it is thought that it was who wanted pat s cart to take her to the station it s a good ten mile but she got there all the same yon said something about a curse yes sir you ll see the hill presently a man who was taking some sheep to the fair saw her there the sun was just getting up and he saw her cursing the raising both her hands sir up to the sun and since that curse was spoken every year a roof has fallen in sometimes two or three i could see he believed the story and for the moment i believed in an outcast becoming the evil spirit of a village that would not accept her as divine look sir the woman coming down the road is and that s her house he said and we passed a house built of loose stones without mortar but a little better than the mud i had seen in father s parish and now sir you will see the parish in ireland and i noticed that though the land was good there seemed to be few people on it and what was more significant than the fields were the ruins for they were not the cold ruins of twenty or thirty or forty years ago when the people were and their turned into pasture â the ruins i saw were the ruins of that had been lately abandoned and i said it wasn t the landlord who these people ah it s the landlord who would be glad to have them back but there s no getting them back here will have to go and tis said that the priest will say mass in an empty chapel a one will be there but ,3

in and near boston had there made margaret s acquaintance attended her conversations accepted her leading ideas and desiring to enjoy her society more intimately and mrs g planned and partly an arrangement whereby her and friend became an of our family and a writer for the up to the close of the in had lived thirteen years in new york and never half a mile from the city hall â usually within sixty rods of it the newspaper business requiring close attention and being wholly down town it seemed when i once ventured to live so far up as street that i had strayed to an inconvenient distance from my work but when the great struggle was over and i the worst beaten man on the continent â worn out by incessant anxiety and effort covered with and thoroughly used up â i took a long stride removing to a spacious old wooden house built as a country or summer residence by formerly president of the united states branch bank but which since his death had been neglected and suffered to decay it was on eight acres of ground including a wooded or on the east river at bay nearly opposite the point of s island amid shade and fruit trees abundant ample garden c and though now for years by streets and in good part covered by buildings was then so secluded as to be only reached by a narrow private lane exceedingly dark at night for one accustomed to the glare of gas lamps the nearest highway being the old boston at forty ninth street while an stage on the third avenue just beyond afforded our me of to and from the city proper accustomed to the and roar of carriages the stillness here at night seemed at first so that i found difficulty margaret fuller in sleeping of the place itself margaret â who became one of our household soon after we took possession â wrote thus to a friend â this place is to me entirely charming j it is so completely in the country and all around is so bold and free it is two miles or more from the thickly settled parts of new york but and cars give me constant access to the city and while i can readily see what and whom i will i can command time and retirement stopping on the you enter a lane nearly a quarter of a long and going by a small brook and pond that locks in the place and ascending a slightly rising ground get sight of the house which old fashioned and of mellow tint fronts on a flower garden filled with shrubs large vines and trim box borders on both sides of the house are beautiful trees standing fair and clear passing through a wide hall you come out upon a stretching the whole length of the house where one can walk in all and thence by a step or two on a lawn with masses of rocks shrubs and trees overlooking the east gravel paths lead by several turns down the steep bank to the water s edge where round the rocky point a small bay curves in which boats are lying and owing to the currents and the set of the tide the sails glide seeming to greet the house as they sweep by the beauty here seen by moonlight is truly i enjoy it greatly and the receives me as to a home we have seen that the first impressions made by margaret even on those who soon learned to admire her most were not favorable and it was decidedly so in my case a myself and at times scarcely able to ride to and from the office i yet did a day s work each day regardless of nerves or moods but she had no such capacity for incessant labor if quantity only were considered i could easily write ten columns to her one indeed she would only write at all when in the vein and her and other often au labor for days meantime perhaps the interest of the theme had or the book to be had the recollections of a busy life bloom from its cheek by some rival attendance and care were very needful to her she would evidently have been happier amid other and more abundant than onr dwelling and while nothing was said i felt that a richer and more generous diet than ours would have been more with her tastes and wishes then i had a notion that strong minded women should be above the weakness of fearing to go anywhere at any time alone â that the sex would have to itself from to etiquette and the need of a masculine arm in crossing a street or a room before it could expect to fight its way to the bar the bench the box and the nor was i wholly from the vulgar prejudice against female of functions hitherto only on men as the source of their dissatisfaction her cousin a day s conversation with her in delicately says â but the tragedy of s history was deeper yet behind the poet was the woman â the fond and the heroic and disinterested woman the veiy glow of her poetic enthusiasm was but an of affection the very restlessness of her intellect was the confession that her heart had found no home a book worm a a had heard her called but now it was evident that her seeming was virgin pride and her in study the natural vent of emotions which had met no object worthy of life long attachment at once many of her

nation to keep up a constant with its neighbours yet it is the summit of folly for it ever to be b into a treaty for then comes on the non fulfilment and then remonstrance then then then and finally

a gentleman what o the or the sugar chest or lists of velvet which is t pound or yard you your gentry by s bum there are few places more favourable to the study of character than an english country church i was once passing a few weeks at the seat of a friend who resided in the vicinity of one the appearance of which particularly struck my fancy it was one of those rich of quaint antiquity which give such a peculiar charm to english landscape it stood in the midst of a country filled with ancient families and contained within its cold and silent the dust of many noble generations the interior walls were with monuments of every age and style the light the country church streamed through windows with bearings richly in stained glass in various parts of the church were of knights and high born of gorgeous with their in coloured marble on every side the eye was struck with some instance of some haughty memorial which human pride had erected over its kindred dust in this temple of the most humble of all the congregation was composed of the neighbouring people of rank who sat in lined and furnished with prayer books and decorated with their arms upon the doors of the villagers and who filled the back seats and a small gallery beside the organ and of the poor of the parish who were ranged on benches in the the service was performed by a who had a snug dwelling near the church he was a privileged guest at all the tables of the neighbourhood and had been the keenest fox hunter in the county until age and good living had him from doing any thing more than ride to see the hounds throw off and make one at the hunting dinner under the of such a i found it impossible to get into the train of thought suitable to the time and place so having like many other this country church l l feeble christians with my conscience by laying the sin of my own at another person s threshold i occupied myself in making observations on my neighbours i was as yet a stranger in england and curious to notice the manners of its fashionable classes i found as usual that there was the least where there was the most acknowledged title to respect i was particularly struck for instance with the family of a nobleman of high rank consisting of several sons and daughters nothing could be more simple and than their appearance they generally came to church in the and often on foot the young ladies would stop and converse in the kindest manner with the caress the children and listen to the stories of the humble their countenances were open and beautifully fair with an expression of high refinement but at the same time a frank cheerfulness and an engaging their brothers were tall and formed they were dressed but simply with strict neatness and propriety but without any or their whole was easy and natural with that lofty grace and noble frankness which souls that have never been checked in their growth by feelings of inferiority there is a vol i m l te the about real dignity that never contact and communion with others however humble it is pride that is morbid and sensitive and from every touch i was pleased to see the manner in which they would converse with the about concerns and field sports in which the gentlemen of this country so much delight in these conversations there was neither on the one part nor on the other and you were only of the difference of rank by the habitual respect of the peasant in contrast to these was the family of a wealthy citizen who had vast fortune having purchased the estate and mansion of a ruined nobleman the neighbourhood was endeavouring to assume style and dignity of an hereditary lord of the soil the family always came td church en prince they were rolled along in a carriage with arms the crest glittered in silver radiance from every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed a fat coachman in a three hat and a wig curling close round his rosy face was seated on the box with a sleek dog beside him two in gorgeous with huge and gold headed behind the carriage rose and sunk the country church l i oil its long springs with peculiar ss of the very horses their bite their necks and glanced their eyes more proudly than horses either because they had got a little of the family feeling or were up more tightly than ordinary i could not but admire the style with which this splendid was brought up to the of th church yard there was a vast effect produced aâ the turning of an angle of e wall â a great of tb whip and of th horses glistening of harness an flashing of wheels gravel this moment of and vain glory to the coachman the horses were urged and checked until they were fretted into a foam they threw out their feet in a trot dashing about pebbles at every step the crowd of villagers quietly to church opened to the right and left in vacant admiration reaching the gate the horses were pulled up with a suddenness that produced an immediate stop and almost threw them on they there was an extraordinary hurry of the footman to alight open the door pull down the steps and prepare every thing for the descent on earth of this â august family the old citizen first emerged his round red face from out the door looking about m the country church him with the air of a man accustomed to rule on change and shake the stock market with a nod his a fine comfortable dame followed him there seemed ,6

hissing shower low pools arise and into floods like rushing waves the leafy woods while beaten level as the plain lie lost and hopeless in the rain and william saw the ruin spread and oft arose at midnight from his bed to listen if the rushing rains had ceased or if the wrath of heaven was yet appeased but midnight only seemed to o er all that was bleak and desolate before louder rushed the foaming torrent then and heavier fell the rain drops on the pane how dreary were those hours of midnight gloom to the lone parent in his cheerless room and sorely did he need a hand to smooth his restless â a gentle voice to soothe the sons of the soil but she was gone who would have stayed his soul from sinking by the silent sweet control of woman s influence and of woman s love bearing his spirit this rude world above sad were the scenes which met the farmer s eye when forth he went his scattered to tie thick heaps o er which the rank weeds threw â their arms and down the burden drew while com in coarse lay prone on the ground â in the clay these met his view and filled with rain and all his grain and then his dripping with the showers wasting in idleness their hours beneath the hedge behind the or where the extends her leaves yet all expecting payment on the day their full wages he was wont to pay book x it was a sight to move the farmer s heart â to make the tear drop start in henry s eye for he had much at stake his home to lose â his fortune all to make and he was young and life to him was fair how could he look around and not despair how could he look around and see the waste â the desolation o er his prospects cast nor ask whence had come the how had he to merit such a doom or worse â why heaven should blast the generous boon so freely given â repented of so soon thus questioned but no peace arose or ever ill from reasoning on the laws by which thb world is governed and sustained enough for us that god own end is gained that end beyond the range of human mind most wise most just most merciful and kind the sons of the soil the by discipline to bear with brow unchanged the heaviest weight of care was sad but silent and no murmuring word or sound impatient from his lips was heard but henry restless as a child with dark almost wild reckoned his loss and counted o er his fears while his fair bride reproached him with her tears for making her the partner of his home ere he had known what sorrows were to come so passed that gloomy season and there grew from out the general grief new small but yet frequent â who should most give up or most retain â that seems the bitter drop that all when we have made display of casting away to find that others will not give their share or learn from us their luxuries to spare book x then each effort â fails each noble aim if they withhold we long to do the same or while the good remains with them we wish it ours and still condemn thus all the farmer s family believed their purpose right but o er each other grieved watchful of the rest her censure oil implied more than expressed if dressed too well or looked too fine or had too weak an appetite to dine while she in her quiet way the could well convey or by her servant send an insult down the maiden aunt s to say not that means bring to dread save in the actual want of daily bread the sons of the soil they bring the very worst of human the bitterest draught our earthly cup that fills they bring domestic â and envy mother of the sin â injurious thoughts â words that and the spirit to return the pain it suffers on the s head then say not poverty brings to dread yet came not these in their most hideous form â in their full power to and within the farmer s hospitable home how could such fearful discord ever come twas but the shallow

the church yard before his grave was green and yet what bond of union could possibly exist between the haughty lord and the humble he surrounded by luxury and wealth yet suspended but for a few brief moments above the gloomy grave and she a simple country maiden apparently pursuing her homely path with patient steps yes there was a bond them the bond of sympathy felt and acknowledged by both sympathy of taste and thought and feeling sympathy of high purpose and noble sentiment sympathy which no difference of rank or station can subdue sympathy in the inward of the spirit which struggled in vain to support its own existence clinging in its weakness to the of earth and again and again the offer of that hand which alone is mighty to save it was in the cheerful month of june that the noble invalid and the young artist sat together at an open window during the quiet morning hours before the hall was disturbed by and while the dew was yet upon the grass for now they found both time and inclination to converse and lord cast his melancholy eyes upon the clear landscape the blue hills the shining river the green slopes and the deep shadows of the trees but neither the fair landscape nor the scent of summer flowers the hum o bees nor the song of merry birds brought gladness to his soul for he was losing his firm step upon the earth and looking almost his last upon the smiling flowers and listening to the birds that would soon be their happy flight above his grave you will be here said he as if continuing the mournful train of his you will be here when summer comes again and i he paused and looked earnestly at words were upon her lips which might have been in such an hour but she dared not utter them how did her spirit to answer and you will be in heaven all that woman can say with eyes that shine through tears was written in her countenance but she made no audible reply and her companion went on quoting the words of i am egypt dying a fatal malady is upon my heart yet i brave it out to the world and none but my faithful knows that i endure any other than bodily suffering even he knows not the cause but to you i will confess that when i think of forth the boundless ocean of eternity i fed like a fearful child about to enter upon a region of impenetrable darkness in my ride the other day i saw a poor woman sitting at the door of her cottage reading her bible and oh how i envied the hall and the cottage that humble creature upon what to her were the words of eternal truth the same book said is open to all and it is the perfection of that volume that its sacred truths are equally its moral equally serviceable and its religious equally available to the high and the low the rich and the poor the happy and the miserable lord shook his head my mother forced me when a child to learn long lessons from the bible as a punishment when i did wrong and i have never been able o read it since if you would but try my lord said will you read it to replied his and then he smiled as dying men have no right to smile i would do anything said in her own manner to make you less melancholy less and i would were it possible for me to be in raising your thoughts to a in those hopes which alone are able to support the soul in its hour of mortal trial how is this said lord and while he spoke and looked earnestly at tears burning tears were in his eyes and he stretched forth his thin and wasted hand and grasped her arm with something of energy my course through this world has been short and eccentric winning the wonder of the many and the love of the few had i not beneath the shallow surface of profession my vanity might have in yet have i never known from my cradle until this hour one friend who cared about my soul â has been very unfortunate amongst the first of earthly blessings which heaven bestowed upon me was a faithful friend a friend whose counsel and kindness have been as a light upon my path and will vou be this friend to me impossible my lord why impossible because you are a man noble and wealthy and accomplished and i am a woman young and poor and and for these qualities i love you better and surely for those you cannot respect me the less my lord tliat very weakness which your tenderness and that dignity which me into respect are with the fair and nature of friendship then call it love if you will it matters little what name is given to an intimacy like ours to be dissolved in a few brief moments but oh do not leave me to myself come often sit with me till you are weary and above all things tell me how to make death less horrible ah you are going again going to gather roses and sit within your sunny bower and listen to the birds that overhead and feel the breath of summer fan your blooming cheek and think not of the weary hours that i am spending indeed why should i am nothing to you i can be nothing and have no right to trouble you with my fruitless held out one hand while with the other she

magnificent bed in a chamber richly with pier glasses and massive tables with silver of exquisite the walls were covered with the richly gilded through the door which stood open she perceived a superb saloon with statues and crystal ai d a the student of magnificent of apartments beyond of the room were open to admit the soft breath of summer which stole in laden with from a neighbouring garden from whence also the refreshing sound of fountains and the sweet notes of birds came in mingled music to her ear female attendants were moving with noiseless step about the chamber but she feared to address them she doubted whether this were not all delusion or whether she was not still in the palace of don and that her escape and all its circumstances had not been but a feverish dream she closed her eyes again endeavouring to recall the past and to separate real from the imaginary the last scenes of consciousness however rushed too forcibly with all their horrors to her mind to be doubted and she turned shuddering from the recollection to gaze once more on the quiet and serene magnificence around her she again opened her eyes they rested on an object that at once every alarm at the head of her bed sat a venerable form the student of watching over her with a look of fond anxiety â it was her father i will not attempt to describe the scene that ensued nor the moments of rapture which more than repaid all the sufferings that her affectionate heart had undergone as soon as their feelings had become more calm the stepped out of the room to introduce a stranger to whom he was indebted for his life and liberty he returned leading in no longer in his poor scholar s garb but in the rich dress of a nobleman the feelings of were almost overpowered by these sudden and it was some time before

the father though a very passionate was a very reasonable man as appears by his that his son should return to and conduct as his bride to away then don hurried back full of joyous he still to throw

be thought of at this time in reference to her condition the young man started so suddenly at this that he his aching limb and uttered a cry of pain you ought to know he complained his face con love gone astray with suffering from a double cause that such a warning is unnecessary not only to day but never if there is any way to prevent it shall i allude in the most remote degree to any peculiarity in that matter i trust though my present position may lead you to doubt it that i have still in my veins the blood of a gentleman the made haste to the disagreeable effect of his suggestion and when he had succeeded in so doing he went to write the note to mrs gray informing her of the reason why she must come to his office instead of to the parlor of the hotel which had formerly been for the meeting he smiled gravely as he began the with the words my dear mrs g i regret to inform you that your husband has met with a slight accident when he had placed the letter in an envelope he did not write any address on the outside but gave it to his most faithful assistant with orders to put it into no hands but those of colonel s daughter at the hour came to the office and was escorted into gray s presence mr remained only long enough to make his and then with a smile left them together it took but a glance to show mr gray the beauty of the young girl he had promised to take foi his wife even the terrible suffering she had under gone could not blot out the loveliness of her features which must have been handsome short months before her form was rounded show husband and wife ing an earlier than usual development and she dressed with a quiet taste that spoke volumes for her judgment in such matters her eyes and were dark these observations were the easier made because the girl kept her gaze to the carpet for some seconds after she entered the room but before she spoke one opinion that had formed itself unconsciously in his mind there was nothing in her of the he had supposed if she was pale she was not weak her veins were full of rich blood that only the strangeness of the occasion had driven from her cheeks and still she seemed withal the of modesty and he could not understand no not in the least how it could be true what he had heard of her and there was nothing yet to testify at least to his inexperienced eyes the cause of her presence in that chamber it was she who first broke the silence i am sorry you have been hurt she said in a low but rich voice you are kind to say so he answered and his own tones sounded strange to him as if they were another s a horse with mine as i was riding this morning the doctor says i shall be out in a week then he paused having reached the end of all he wanted to say on that point he realized now with eyes averted that she was studying him as intently as he had been studying her she had as much reason perhaps when a girl is to live with a man for love gone astray the rest of her days it is important to know what he is like saw that her future lord was not ugly in appearance and that his bearing was agreeable though naturally somewhat strained at this time with a thought to the opinion of the world which she had begun a little late to care for she decided that he would satisfy as a suitable mate for her i am glad it is no worse she said when the silence became painful she looked about the room the pictures while he stole another searching glance at her features how he asked himself again could such a girl as that be won to it was inconceivable she who could hardly muster courage to talk there with him in a closed room while he lay helpless on a sofa this reflection was in his countenance when turning suddenly to speak again she saw it there and paused with a crimson cheek oh this is too hard she exclaimed bursting into sobs yes it is too hard for both of us i did not think you would mind not in the same way i do i did not realize what it must mean to you much distressed gray raised himself on an elbow and her to be calm all the chivalry in his nature was aroused he pitied the girl from the bottom of his heart her unexpected flood of raised her immensely in his estimation everything is arranged now everything is understood he answered soothingly mr has husband and wife procured the of of our marriage let me beg you not to repeat these she arose and threw herself on the floor by the side of the sofa laying her head on his bosom while she wept softly he was distressed as much by this move as the former one but he had not the heart to forbid it at least it led in the direction they would ultimately have to take listen he said when she had grown a little we must understand everything exactly alike let us see if we agree on all points for as we have

for the love she had home her husband had been a thing apart from the rest of her life and though that was snapped it might well be that the other strings of being remained unbroken though alas without their music he had left her for the last time with some reference to dining at his club â he was in fact about to start for â and to this her mind attached itself she imagined every day that this had happened but a few hours ago and her servants were instructed not to interfere with her fond delusion his s study was arranged each morning as it was wont to be when he had it his newspaper was cut and placed upon his desk his boots in winter time put near the fire some people thought that of late years the truth had slowly dawned upon his unhappy widow she put the same question to the butler every evening still but without the sigh that had of old accompanied it the poor soul they said though conscious of her weakness felt ashamed after so many years to acknowledge it but her niece was not of this opinion she believed lady s faith was as firm as ever that her husband was in the flesh and only thought that he was her somewhat more than usual under these circumstances it her for his sake not to appear to pine but to bear herself bravely on other points lady was as sane as other people and on some much she had had in early life a genuine gift of humor and even now an occasional gleam would leap out from some corner of her mind half playful half pathetic her heart was as tender to the woes of others as before it had been broken but its had ceased she had no fears â of old she ji id been of them â for the welfare of those e she let the world move on around her without attempting to set right what was amiss in it and she smiled though veiy kindly at those who still endeavored so to do indeed it was difficult for any two good women to have less in common than lady and sister as she called herself but each esteemed and loved the other though herself a person of strong practical piety had a secret respect for the delusion under which the elder lady labored with respect to her dead husband it was better she said to treat the dead as living than the living as so many did as though they were in another world or not of the same flesh and blood nay though she knew her uncle by marriage to have been an absolutely worthless scoundrel she did not think him past praying for even yet whereas her aunt had she thought her husband dead would have ceased to pray for him almost every act of the lives of these two persons was performed with a difference as they sat down to table for example on the present occasion lady bent down over her plate murmured a few words as it seemed to the outside of it and then proceeded to help the soup sister on the other hand

some sparkling he would begin i am afraid he must have been an indifferent aunt well he was certainly not very he only reminded me of yourself of course in the particular i mentioned do i then alter my grace if there are long glasses inquired sister in that somewhat tone which religious assume when respect them to a my dear you are very literal said the old lady laughing i only meant the parallel to extend to the change of grace not to the reason of it i noticed that you said a longer one than usual to day is it a feast of the church or a fast or what it is neither one nor the other aunt nor was my grace longer than ordinary if you really wish to know and will not mock at me for telling you i was saying a short prayer a thousand dear she reached out her thin white hand sparkling with

that was the very thing in it that most displeased the other she did not like having as it were a compliment paid her at the expense of her principles who was she that she should between this woman

fair his head fairly broken i have only been a week with mr his and i foresee that will become a very the lake intimate acquaintance of mine all last evening was spent reading his and if i know him so well in london what will it be when we go down to to day mr is reading in the british museum there are few books here but his library in is i hear one of the finest private in england and every window looks out on the park think of me sitting there learning hebrew raising my eyes now and again to admire the curves of the beautiful trees showing against the sky and the great branches of the copper sweeping the green turf there are a number of deer in the park and they come down to drink at the pond that is all i know of but i will write to you and tell you my impressions of the library and the park we are going there in a few days and to tell you this is one of my reasons in writing to you for i should be disappointed if you were to come to london and i was not here to sing the ave maria for you we are i believe going abroad at the end of july miss wants to go to germany to hear some music but nothing is settled yet i told you in my first letter that something was going to happen to me â well that something has happened and so far as i can judge from a week s experience i am perfectly satisfied very sincerely yours rose the lake from father to miss rose june â our letters crossed both letters were posted on thursday evening so while i am reading your letter about mr and his writings you are reading my explanation why i did not answer your letter at once i think i omitted to say that your letter alarmed me so much that i thought more than once of sending it on to father o and if i did not do so it was because my first blunder has rendered me cautious i remembered that i had no right to show your letter to anyone a letter is a bewildering thing even the most ordinary often fill one with doubt if father were to write to me saying he would call at three o clock tomorrow and if he didn t arrive if he were half an hour late i should be walking up the room going to the front door and having considered every possible accident sick calls broken i should turn to his letter and wonder what day he meant when he wrote tomorrow asking myself if the letter were written before p m or a m now if a simple note making an appointment can give rise to so much it is easy to imagine the restlessness such a letter as yours would stir up in one as intimately concerned in your welfare as i am knowing you as i do i was disposed to look upon the fancies expressed in your first letter as the natural bent of your mind without particular significance the lake and many things me to take this view i could not forget that i wished you to leave london maybe i said this wish me to believe that she is not safe in london i am a prejudiced person then i remembered suddenly after the letter that you were working under the guidance of father o and i was seized with o science and returned home asking if i did well in writing to you as strongly as i did it seemed tâ me my letter might be regarded as the of father o s sanction and guidance now what position does my letter put me in i said to myself i drove a woman out of my parish to live or die as best she could she meets a good who extends a friendly hand and puts her in the way of earning her bread but on the first opportunity i again and use every effort in my power to get her away from him not only do i do this i even ventured to him advancing as an argument that he had deserted his country i walked home overcome alarmed at my own feeling myself entirely unable to cope with life and i do not think anything could have dissipated this mood except your last letter i see now that i was suffering from what is known as a false conscience my scruples were of course i did quite right in asking you to return to ireland i am quite sure now that father o would not have of the letter i wrote to you he certainly would not if i were to send him the letter which you have written to me he would say your suspicions that london is a great danger for a young woman like her are fully justified by her letter only by a miracle can she live there without falling â i will not say into sin but into the dangerous occasions of sin there is i admit no single passage in your letter which by itself would seem a sufficient cause for my anxiety it may be quite true that is a more correct than the usual i m not in a position to argue the point but i certainly think that you might have expressed yourself more reverently nor can i approve of the way in which you speak of and rome though there is no doubt that what you say is true i find fault not so much with what you say as with the levity with which you express yourself another point you say you are sure i will agree with you that it would be madness to miss this opportunity the opportunity of ,3
rubbing one up the wrong way then do you not remember how we danced in one room while the servants set the other out with little tables the supper was fascinating i i suppose it was these pleasant which made me wish for the shoes but i could not summon up courage enough to buy them and die horrid people were comparing me with the i suppose i did look a little mysterious with a double veil bound across my face the shoes went with a lot of other things â and oh to whom so now that pretty little retreat in the de la tour des is ended for ever for you and me we shall not see the in again i was of a young man thinking of going to see him the other day but the street is so steep my coachman advised me to spare v the horse s hind legs i believe it is the street in paris and your luncheon parties how i did enjoy them and how did enjoy them too and what i risked short sighted as i am picking my way from the down to that out of the way little street men never appreciate the risks women run for them but to leave my letters lying about â i cannot forgive that when i told she said what can you expect i warned you against with boys i never did before â never paris is now just as it was when you used to sit on the balcony and i read you you never liked his poetry and i cannot understand why i have found a new poem which i am sure would convert you you should be here there are in the room and the is beautiful upon a great sky and the long avenue is into violet we have already begun to think of where we shall go to this year last year we went to p an place quite rustic but within easy distance of a i had vowed not to dance for i had been out every night during the season but the temptation proved irresistible and i gave way there were two young men here one the count of of a young man b the other the of g one of the best families in france a distant cousin of my husband he has written a book which every one says is one of the most amusing things that has appeared for years he paid me great attentions and made my husband wildly jealous i used to go out and sit with him amid the rocks and it was perhaps very lucky for me that he went away we may return there this year if so i wish you would come and spend a month there is an excellent hotel where you would be very comfortable we have decided nothing as yet the de is giving a costume ball they say it is going to be a most wonderful affair i don t know what money is not going to be spent upon the i have just got home a fascinating i am going as a you know a short skirt and a little cap the gave a ball some few days ago i danced the with l who as you know dances il m a la but it is of course no use you know that the other night we went to see the de a fascinating play and i am reading the book i don t know which i like the best i think the play but the book is very good too now that is what i call a novel and i am a judge for i have read all novels but i must not talk literature or of a young man you will say something stupid i wish you would not make foolish remarks about men that paris considers the it does not matter so much with me i know you but then people laugh at you behind your back and that is not nice for me the was here the other day and she said she almost wished you would not come on her days so extraordinary were the remarks you made and by the way the has written a book i have not seen it but i bear that it is really too she is but the way she herself is too much for any one she never goes anywhere now without le d it is a great pity and now my dear friend write me a nice letter and tell me when you are coming back to paris i am sure you cannot amuse yourself in that hateful london the thing about you was that you were really come back and take a nice apartment on the you might come back for the s ball i will get an invitation for you and will keep the for you the idea of running away as you did and never telling any one where you were going to i always said you were a little cracked and letting all your things be sold if you had only told me i should like so much to have had that lamp yours of a young man how like her that letter is â vain foolish no not foolish â narrow limited but not foolish worldly oh how worldly i and yet not so for there always was in her a certain intensity of feeling that saved her from the commonplace and gave her charm she can feel and she has lived her life and felt it and sincerely â like a caught in a curtain would that sincerity sincerity seems to convey an idea of depth and she was not very deep that is quite certain â a little brain that span rapidly and a pretty humming tune but no there was something more in her than that she often said things ,3
practise he had accordingly adapted his behavior to the complexion of this population and maintained his authority both over his own and such of the opposite party as had fallen into his hands by a severe and not by even a cruel bearing following the example set him by himself he had more than once executed summary vengeance upon the whom the chances of war had brought into his power or what was equally had allowed the tory bands who had under his banner to gratify their own thirst of blood in the most towards butler however he himself with more consideration â and sometimes even extended to him such little as might be indulged without i shoe robin k risk to the principal purpose of his safe a separate room was provided for the prisoner and he was allowed the occasional services of harry winter and the other companions of his late misfortune still the familiar scenes of suffering and death which butler was constrained to witness amongst his and the consciousness of his own inability to these greatly weighed upon his spirits his persuasion too that was now by what seemed to be a most effectual in the plan for the capture of and his belief that this blow would sadly if not altogether the friends of independence in the south added to his private grief he knew nothing of the of the and saw no hope of from the difficulties that threatened to his cause such was the condition of butler during the first four or five days of his at town at the end of this period circumstances occurred to raise in his bosom the most lively excitement suddenly an order was issued for the immediate movement of the army â and the prisoners were directed to accompany the march it was apparent that information of importance had been received and that some decisive event was at hand when in of this command the troops were for their journey and butler was stationed in the column along with all the other prisoners of the post he was startled to observe the james appear in the ranks as one regularly attached to the corps butler had seen nor heard nothing of this man since he had parted from him at s after the battle of s mill and his conviction that acting under the control of some higher authority this individual had been the principal agent in his present misfortunes gave him a painful anxiety in regard to the future this anxiety was far from being diminished when he now discovered that the same person with a party of was specially with his winter and the other who had until this moment been allowed to keep him company were now directed to take a station amongst the common prisoners and butler was furnished with his horse and commanded to submit to the particular of robin k â the these arrangements being made the march of commenced the army moved cautiously towards the upper sections of tht district of ninety six it was evident to butler from the frequent hints dropped in conversation by the officers that supposed himself to be getting every moment nearer to in this state of suspense and weariness the first day s march was concluded the second was like the first still moved south slowly but steadily every man that was met upon the road was questioned by the commanding officer to ascertain whether there was any report of troops westward any crossed â or been heard of towards the mountains â was an invariable none that the person questioned knew of â was the common reply the devil s in it that we can hear nothing of the fellow exclaimed after the fifth or sixth had been examined and his beggars are flesh and blood â they

where was then u marching towards with brown â following as it was supposed â but on rather a cold scent as one of the reported i must get still nearer to the mountains said as he clenched his teeth and seemed absorbed in thought in a short time after this the column from their former course by a road that led westward thus ended the second day during the next two days had become more in his movement and spent the greater portion of this interval upon a road which was said to extend from ninety six to the mountain here he remained with the of the tiger that to spring upon his prey and it was with a temper that after this anxious watch for forty eight hours he turned upon his heel and summoned his officers around him and announced his determination to penetrate still further into the forest like a man perplexed and with crosses he soon changed his mind and ordered a lieutenant of cavalry into his presence u take six of your best appointed men he said u and send one half of them up this road towards the mountains â the other half â and command them not to stop until they bring me some news of this night hawk let them be men that you can depend upon i will wait but twenty four

could not interpret and she could not confide her secret and there was an sadness in these last kisses and s heart seemed to stand still when he said â her last wish was our marriage she would be glad if she could see us hid her face on his shoulders several times he thought she was weeping but her eyes remained dry he came to her room that evening and now that they were lovers again it seemed to him impossible that she could refuse to marry him but she stood looking at him absorbed in the presence of her future life her eyes full of a strange farewell he could no word from her and her eyes retained their strange melancholy till her departure his last memory of her visit was their melancholy chap xxv the forces within her were at she was conscious of a of the moment was one in which she saw as in a mirror her poor vague little soul in its hopeless wandering through life she drew back not daring to see herself and then was drawn forward by a curiosity she felt towards them so differently that she could not think of herself as the same person when she was with as she was when she was with she remembered what she had heard the say and she remembered the sin bat apart from the deception she practised upon both men there was the wrong doing her conscience did not her now but she knew that she would suffer to morrow or next day that sense of sin which she could not from her nature would rise to her lips like a salt wave and poison her life with its bitterness and she asked herself vain questions why had she left her father why had she two lovers why did she rise to seek things that made her unhappy she thought of yesterday s journey to see a dying woman and of to night s performance of and what an unhappy the bitter wave of conscience which rose to her lips and poisoned her taste forced from her an that she would mend her life she foresaw nothing but deception and easily imagined that not a day would pass without lies all her life would be a lie and when her nature rose in vehement revolt she looked round for means to free herself from the and chains in which she had locked herself thinking of she vowed that it must not happen again but what excuse would she give should she tell him that was her lover that was the only way only it seemed so brutal even so she would have a lover and strictly speaking she ought to send them both away very probably that is what she would do in the end in the meantime she would keep them both on her face contracted in an expression of terror and disgust had her then ended in such miserable selfishness as this to escape from her thoughts she looked out at the landscape hoping it would her but she could take no interest in it yesterday it had seemed so beautiful but to day it was all reversed and the light was different she preferred to remember it she thought that they must be the river and she remembered how in one place it ran round a fields making a silver in the green land they had crossed it twice in the space of a quarter of a mile then it followed the railway placid reflecting the trees and sky then like a child it was soon taken with a new idea it ran far away out of sight and thought it would never return but it came hack again turbulent and shallow and with woods on the steep and by a beautiful stone bridge a little later its wanderings grew still more and she was not sure that it had not been joined in some strange way by another river but flowing round a low lying field coming suddenly from behind a bend in the land it had seemed in that place like a pond one bank was lined with bushes the other lay open to a view of a plain divided by three ladies had held their light boat in the deep current and she had wondered who they were and what was their manner of living and their desires and though she would never know these things the image of these ladies in their boat had fixed itself in her mind for ever soon after the train began to speed and nervously she awaited her destiny for she was uncertain whether she would send a telling him to come to park lane or whether she would drive straight to his lodgings at the bottom of her heart she knew that when she arrived at st she would tell the queen s square and an hour later nervous with expectation she sat in the cab seeing the streets pass behind her she was beginning to know the characteristics of the neighbourhood and in the afternoon light they awoke her out of a trembling she recognised the old iron the open space the thirsty fountain and the troop of neglected children she liked the forlorn and rusty square she experienced a sort of sinking anguish while waiting on the lest he might not be at home but when the servant girl said mr dean was upstairs she liked her good smile and she loved the stairs and â it was all wonderful and she could hardly believe that in a few moments more she would catch the first sight of his face she would have to tell some part of the truth and since lady was dead he could not fail to believe he would never think of asking her â she put the ugly thought aside and ran up the second flight in the pauses of their ,3
however inadequate may be our comprehension of it i infer that alike in all men will be whenever they shall need to be and that neither by suicide nor any device can a single individual escape the

state of anguish and suffering are depicted were not meant to be taken literally â i yet realize that human is often so and enormous that its punishment to be just and must be severe and protracted

application of her husband s hands to her waist next followed mr and mrs with less demonstration of bliss a sober couple of the john type while in the rear came mr and hand in hand as usual the two young men were in great spirits which with was a common case but was of a serene and philosophic turn of mind which was the cause of no little on the part of his friend and fellow this afternoon however no one could complain of mr on the score of want of vivacity for he was all sorts of fun at â it must be owned to the young ladies great amusement â on account of a commission he had received that morning from his magazine editor to write the in verse for a certain illustration to appear in the next monthly number it is generally understood said that we artists are set to illustrate the poets but the of the has reversed all that mr has a drawing on hand of an italian organ boy with a monkey which he chooses to call the exile and is the bard directed to it in a poem his eye has been in a fine frenzy rolling ever since breakfast but he can t find a rhyme to exile in vain protested that his eye was all right â though not perhaps so much directed towards the main chance as that of a certain portrait painter he could mention and that he didn t want a rhyme to exile that he knew better and the young ladies to assist his friend the poem must be sent by to morrow s post and if you can t find a rhyme would you be good enough to suggest an i ot s notion is that there should bo me on â a tbey stopped on the hill to laugh t ie â ia a from a thorn rest â and that the sight of them should suggest his distant home to the italian youth and draw tears whenever he looks at them but his difficulty â i mean s difficulty â is that he don t know and can t find out whether white are native of italy do either of you happen to know though mr addressed both the young ladies he looked towards â indeed it would almost seem since he had never shown such high spirits before that it was she who had inspired them â and therefore she felt called upon to reply i don t know about white she said but if i had to write a poem on such a subject â which would be a task however utterly beyond my powers â i should bring the boy into some such scene as this which would remind him ever so slightly of his own mountains and blue skies on th contrary said you should make him feel the contrast as s as possible my dear take him into where it s all flat and make him cry because he has no hills to climb because he gets beef and beer given him instead of and sour wine because he is not devoured in this country by insects that with because now and then he sees a silver coin which i am sure he never did in italy miss is quite right said interrupting this and i am much obliged to her for her suggestion perhaps she could find you a rhyme for exile observed for she felt that she was no longer the first a position which as the only young unmarried lady in the hotel she had hitherto enjoyed in relation to these two young men her remark fell flat knows the effect of the of a worn out jest â and had a influence upon the little company presently dropped a pencil out of ner drawing case and helping her to find it the two fell a few paces behind the other couple i hope miss he you don t think i do my work poor as it is quite so mechanically as would have you believe indeed i don t she said good i quite understand mr s fun i know when he is serious that he is a gi eat admirer of your talents oh as to that i have next to none he answered it is s way to speak more highly of his friends than they deserve as compensation i suppose k r his modesty as regards himself he calls himself a portrait painter in which line he is indeed best known but he has a keen eye for the beauties of a and a cunning hand for their you must see his â which are chiefly taken from the neighbourhood â at our lodgings they are really a visit and ib there no chance of our ii u m some one p the no indeed replied the other j there is not the least danger of such an i did not mean that at all said earnestly you did not think i could be so rude i hope indeed i should like to hear or read your poems you are very kind to say so the public i am sorry to say are not so civil but it must be very interesting work writing stories and poems and very pleasant to see them afterwards in print you smile â you are thinking that women have a great deal of vanity not at all in that respect we men â those who are authors at least â are not one whit behind the ladies i was smiling because though as you say it is very pleasant to appear in print my productions do not always meet with that good fortune they are sometimes declined with thanks by wicked that must be very sad what do you do then i smoke my pi e and think how was and flatter myself mine is ,12

t do to let him think i m drunk again she said to herself as she threw aside what she had written and read over one of her previous efforts it ran as follows my darling dick â you will i am sure be sorry to hear that i have been very ill i am now however much better indeed i may say quite recovered during my illness i have been thinking over our quarrels and i now see how badly how i have behaved to you on many occasions i do not know and i scarcely dared to hope that you will ever forgive me but i trust that you will not refuse to see me for a few minutes i have not i assure you tasted spirits for some weeks so you need not fear i will kick up a row i will promise to be very quiet i will not reproach you nor get excited nor raise my voice i shall be very good and will not detain you but fo r a very short time you will not you a s wife cannot oh my darling deny me this one little request â to see you again although only for a few minutes your affectionate wife â compared with the thoughts of her these words appeared to her weak and poor but feeling that for the moment at least she could not add to their intensity she set out on her walk hoping to find her husband at the theatre it was about eight o clock in the evening a light g ey fog hung over the background of the streets and the line of the was almost lost in the shadows that fell from a coloured sky here and there a or the sharp spire of a church tore the muslin like curtains of descending mist and vague as the mist were her thoughts the streets twisted their luminous way through and gloom whilst at every turning the broad windows of the public houses marked the english highway but paid no attention to the red temptations and hopeful as a tired animal thinking of its stable she walked through the dark crowd that pressed upon her nor did she even notice when she was but went on a heedless â a something in a black shawl and a bonnet a slippery stepping stone between the low women who whispered and the who hurried home with the tin of evening beer in her hand like one held and guided by the power of a dream she lost consciousness of all that was not of it thoughts of how dick would receive her and forgive her were folded entangled land broken within narrow limits of time half an hour passed like a minute and she found a s wife herself at the stage door of the theatre drawing the letter from her pocket she said to the will you give mr this letter has he arrived yet yes hut he s busy for the moment but the man added as he examined s features narrowly you ll excuse me i made a mistake mr isn t in the theatre at that moment the swinging door was thrust open and the call boy screamed mr says you re not to let miss thomas pass to night and if there are any letters for him i m to take them in here s one will you give it to mr said eagerly thrusting forward her note say that i m waiting for an answer the stage door keeper tried to but before he could explain himself the boy had rushed away all letters should be given to me he growled as he turned away to argue with miss thomas who had just arrived in a few minutes the call boy came back will you please step this way he said to no you shan t cried the if you try any nonsense with me i shall send round for a policeman started back frightened thinking these words were addressed to her but a glance showed her that she was mistaken oh how dare you talk to me like that you re an beast cried miss thomas pass under my arm ma am said the i don t want this one to get through and amid a storm of violent words and the strains of distant music went up a narrow staircase that under the weight of a group of girls in strange dresses when a s wife she got past them she saw dick at tlie door of his room waiting for her the table was covered with letters the walls with bills a great success he took her hand and placed her in a chair and at first it seemed doubtful who would break an awkward and silence at last dick said i m sorry to hear that you ve been ill you re looking well now yes i m better now she replied but perhaps if i d died it would have been as well for you can never love me again you know my dear he said that we didn t get on well together oh dick i know it you were very good to me and i made your life wretched on account of my jealousy but i couldn t help it for i loved you better than a woman ever loved a man i cannot tell you i cannot find words to express how much i love you you re everything to me i lived for your love i m dying of it yes dick i m dying for love of you i feel it here it me like a fire and what is so strange is that nothing seems real to me except i never think of anything but of things that concern you anything that ever belonged to you i treasure up as a you know the of pearls i used to ,3
hung on her arm the house was a large brick edifice with a roof covered with moss small windows with pillars somewhat out of repair a big high hall and a staircase wide enough to drive a up it if it could have turned the corners a grove of great forest oaks and shaded it and made it look rather gloomy and the garden with the old covered with at one end was almost in front while the side of the wood â a forest from which the place took its came up so close as to form a strong dark background during the war the place like most others in that my cousin suffered greatly and only a sudden exhibition of spirit on cousin s part saved it from a worse fate after the war it went down the fields were poor and grew up in and and the house was too large and out of repair to keep from decay the of it divided between cousin and other members of the family cousin had no means whatever so that it soon was in a bad condition the rest of the family as they grew up went off compelled by necessity to seek some means of and would have taken cousin too if she would have gone but she would not go they did all they could for her but she preferred to hang around the old place and to do what she could with her and old her s husband who alone remained in the quarters she lived in a part of the house up the rest and from time to time visited among her friends and relatives who always received her she had an old piece of a mare which i think she had bought from with one eye three legs and no mane or tail to speak of and on which she without the least perceptible result care enough to have kept a stable in condition in a of humor she named this my cousin animal fashion after a noted of the old times which had been raised in the county had beaten the famous boston in a great race she always spoke of with a tone of real tenderness in her voice and looked after her and discussed her which were always numerous as if she had been a delicate child mounted on this beast with her bags and bundles and and umbrella and a long stick or pole she used occasionally to make the tour of the neighborhood and was always really welcomed because notwithstanding the trouble she gave she always stirred things up as was said once you could no more have remained dull where she was than you could have with a down your back her retort was that a might be used to rouse people from a she had an old maid s tongue by the younger members of the family she was always welcomed because she furnished so much fun she nearly always fetched some little thing to her host â not her hostess â a fowl or a pat of butter from her one old cow or something of the kind because she said had established the precedent and she was a woman of good understanding â she understood that feeding and flattery were the way to win men my cousin she would sometimes have a chicken in a basket hung on the off of her old saddle because at times she fancied she could not eat anything but chicken soup and she did not wish to give trouble she used to give trouble enough for it generally turned out that she had heard some one was sick in the neighborhood and she wanted the soup carried to her i remember how mad joe got because she made him go with her to carry a bucket of soup to old mrs cousin had the marks of an old maid she was thin we used to call her though i remember now she was quite erect until she grew feeble her features were fine her nose was very straight her hair was brown and her eyes which were dark were weak so that she had often to wear a green shade she used to say herself that they were bad eyes they had been so ever since the time when she was a young girl and there had been a very bad attack of scarlet fever at her home and she had caught it i think she caught a bad cold with it â sitting up nursing some of the younger children perhaps â and it had settled in her eyes she was always very liable to cold i believe she had a lover then or about that my cousin time but her mother had died not long before and she had some notion of duty to the children and so discarded him of course as every one said she d much better have married him i do not suppose he ever could have addressed her she never would admit that he did which did not look much like it she was once spoken of in my presence as a sore eyed old maid â i have forgotten who said it yet i can now recall occasions when her eyes being better appeared unusually soft and had she not been an old maid would sometimes have been beautiful â as for instance occasionally when she was playing at the piano in the evenings before the candles were lighted i recollect particularly once when she was singing an old french love song another time was when on a certain occasion some one was talking about marriages and the reasons which led to or prevented them she sat quite still and silent looking out of the window with her thin hands resting in her lap her head was turned away from most of the people but i was sitting where i could ,1
her friend baron the last to assure of his connection with a race as ancient as his appearance baron greeted his hostess with paternal and the young man with an ease which might have been acquired on the stock exchange and in the dressing rooms of leading ladies he spoke a english from which one felt he might pass with equal mastery to half a dozen other languages he inquired for the excellent asked his hostess if she did not mean to give him a drop of tea and a remarked that he need not ask if was still with the dress maker and on the waiter s coming in answer to his ring ordered the tea himself and added a request for fine champagne it was not the first time that had seen such minor liberties taken in mrs s drawing room but they had hitherto been taken by persons who had at least the superiority of knowing what they were permitting themselves whereas the young man felt almost sure that baron s manner was the most distinguished he could achieve and this deepened the disgust with which as the minutes passed he yielded to the conviction that the baron was mrs s aunt the last iv had always foreseen that mrs might some day ask him to do something he should greatly dislike he had never gone so far as to conjecture what it might be but had simply felt that if he allowed his acquaintance with her to pass from to he must be prepared to find himself at any moment in a queer situation the moment had come and he was relieved to find that he could meet it by refusing her request he had not always been sure that she would leave him this alternative she had a way of people in her without their being aware of it and had pictured himself in holes so tight that there might not be room for a happily in this case he could still move freely nothing compelled him to act as an between mrs and her husband and it was preposterous to suppose that even in a life of such perpetual as hers there were no roots which struck deeper than her casual intimacy with himself she had simply laid hands on him because he happened to be within reach and he would put himself out of reach by leaving for london on the morrow having thus inwardly asserted his independence he felt free to let his fancy dwell on the strangeness of the situation he had always supposed that mrs in the last her flight through life must have thrown a good many victims to the wolves and had assumed that mr had been among the number that he had been dropped overboard at an early stage in the lady s career seemed probable from the fact that neither his wife nor his daughter ever mentioned him mrs was incapable of and if her husband had still been an active element in her life he would certainly have figured in her conversation if he thought of the matter at all had concluded that divorce must long since have mr but he now saw how he had his friend s faculty for using up the waste material of hfe she had always struck him as the most extravagant of women yet it turned out that by a miracle of she had for years kept a superfluous husband on the chance that he might some day be useful the day had come and mr was to be called from his obscurity wondered what had become of him in the interval and in what shape he would respond to the the fact that his wife feared he might not respond to it at all seemed to show that his exile was voluntary or had at least come to appear to other but if that were the case it was curious he should not have taken legal means to free himself he could hardly have had his wife s motives f r wishing to maintain the vague tie between them but conjecture lost itself in trying to picture what his point of view was likely to be and on his way the last to the dinner that evening could not help that circumstances denied him the opportunity of meeting so a person the young man s knowledge of mrs s methods made him feel that her husband might be an interesting study this however did not affect his resolve to keep clear of the business he entered the dining room with the firm intention of refusing to execute mrs s commission and if he changed his mind in the course of the evening it was not owing to that lady s s curiosity as to the share in s marriage was appeased before he had been five minutes at their table mrs was an whose ample but outline seemed the result of a well matched struggle between her cook and her she talked a great deal of what was appropriate in dress and conduct and seemed to regard mrs as a final on both points to do or to wear anything would have been extremely to mrs and she was evidently resolved at the price of eternal vigilance to prove her familiarity with what she frequently referred to as the right thing mr appeared to have no such if called on to describe him would have done so by saying that he was the american who always pays the young man in the course of his foreign wanderings had the last come across many fellow citizens of mr s type in the most company and surroundings and wherever they were to be found they always had their hands in their pockets mr s standard of was the extent of a man s capacity to foot the bill and as no one but an occasional cared to dispute the privilege ,11
words and miss said laying her hand on s and my friend here will play my parts until i come back yon must begin to night my dear and try to a s wife work up if you re a quick study you may be able to play it on wednesday night this was too much the tears stood in s eyes she had in her pocket a little gold which she had bought that morning to make a present of to her once hated rivals but she waited until they were to slip it on the good natured s wrist the parting between the two women was very touching and being in a melting mood made a full confession of her quarrel with dick and herself she sought for consolation smiled curiously and after a long pause said i know what you mean dear ive been jealous myself but you ll get over it and learn to take things easily as i do men aren t worth it the last phrase seemed to have slipped from her and seeing how she had shocked she hastened to add dick is a very good fellow and will look after you but take my advice avoid a row we women don t gain anything by it the words dwelt long in s mind but she found it hard to keep her temper her temper surprised even herself it seemed to be giving way and she trembled with rage at things that before would not have stirred an thought in her mind of the passions that used to her when a child returned to her as is generally the case there was right on both sides her life it must be confessed was woven about with temptations dick s character easily suspicion and when the study of the part of was over the iron of distrust began again to force its way into her heart the slightest thing to arouse her on one occasion when travelling from bath to she could not help thinking judging from the expression of the girl s face that a s wife dick was s foot under the without a word she moved to the other end of the carriage and remained looking out of the window for the rest of the journey another time she was seized with a fit of mad rage at seeing dick dancing with at the end of the second act of madame there were floods of tears and a distinct refusal to dress with that woman dick was in despair what could he do there was no spare room and unless she went to dress with the chorus he didn t know what she d do my god he exclaimed to as he rushed across the stage after the property man never have your woman playing in the same theatre as yourself it s awful for the last couple of weeks everything he did seemed to be wrong success instead of satisfying seemed to render her more irritable and instead of herself with the that were nightly upon her her constant occupation was to find out either where dick was or what he had been doing or saying if he went up to make a change without telling her she would invent some excuse for sending to inquire after him if he were giving some directions to the g at one of the top she would walk from the wing where she was waiting for her cue to ask him what he was saying this caused a great deal of merriment in the theatre and in the dressing rooms s imitation of the the manager was put to at night was considered very amusing my dear i assure you you re mistaken i only smoked two after lunch and then i had a glass of beer i swear i m concealing nothing from you and this is scarcely a of the strict a s wife lance under which dick but from a mixture of and good nature it did not seem to annoy him too much and he appeared to be most troubled when murmured that she was tired that she hated the profession and would like to go and live in the country for now she complained of fatigue and weariness the society of those who formed her life no longer interested her and she took violent and it was not for and to make an arrangement to with the whenever a landlady could be discovered who would undertake so much cooking but without being able to explain why declared she could not abide sitting face to face with the heavy lead she saw and heard quite enough of him at the theatre without being by him in the day time dick made no objection indeed he confessed willingly that he was a bit tired of remarks and the wit of and fell to if you didn t laugh at his jokes still continued to board with them and although he and did not always manage to hit it off they managed to rub along without much love helped him to bear with a good deal of and dick regarded him as a sort of over and against which a great deal of away was asked to take s place and the appearance of the little foreigner was a welcome change after s show of genius he could do everything better than anybody else but that did not matter for he was amusing in his relations whether you spoke of s position in modern fiction or the rolling of you were certain tp be interrupted with i assure you my dear fellow you re mistaken uttered in a voice on the subject of his bass voice a s wife a child could draw him out and under the of a comparison between him and one of the bass never failed to him to give the company an idea of his register ,3
there could be no question of failure the man was made for i felt that the first time i clapped eyes on him could hardly keep from asking him to sit to me on the spot but one could n t ask of the fellow i sat still and prayed he d come to me though for i was looking for something big for the next it was twelve years the last time i was out here â and i was for an opportunity i had the feeling â do you writer fellows have it tâ o â that there was something tremendous in me if it could only be got out and i felt was the moses to strike the rock there were vulgar reasons too that made me hunger for a victim i d been grinding on for a good many years without gold or glory and the first thing of mine that had made a noise was my picture of exhibited the year before there d been a lot of talk about that orders were beginning to come in and i wanted to follow it up with a rousing big thing at the next then the bad been that i could do spanish things i i had the nursery au through â and i wanted to show that i had plenty more shot in my don t you get up every morning meaning to prove you re equal to or i that s the way felt then only give me a chance i wanted to shout out to them and i saw at that van was my chance i had come over from paris in the autumn to paint mrs and i met and his daughter at one of the first dinners went to after that i could think of but that man s head what a type i up all the details of his scandalous history and there were enough to fill an the papers were of him just then he was mud from head to foot it was about the time of the big steal and citizens were forming ineffectual to put him down and all the time one kept meeting him at dinners â that was the beauty of it once remember seeing him nest to the bishop s wife i ve got a little sketch of that somewhere well he was simply magnificent a bom ruler what a splendid he would have made in gold with â on his you remember those drawings of s where the knight s face and outline of his combine in one monstrous he always reminded me of that the portrait but how was i to get at him â one day it occurred to me to try talking to miss she was a person who did n t seem to see an inch beyond the last remark one had made but suddenly i myself out i wonder if you know how your father is and you should have seen the change that came over her her eyes lit up and she â well as i ve tried to make her look there he glanced up at the sketch yes she said t her father splendid and didn t i him one of the men i d ever seen that rather staggered me i confess i couldn t think her capable of joking on such a subject yet it seemed impossible that she should be speaking seriously but she was i knew it by the way she looked at who was sitting opposite his thrown back the shaggy locks tossed off his narrow high white forehead the girl worshipped him she went on to say how glad she was that i saw him b she did so many artists admired only regular beauty the stupid greek type that was made to be done in marble but she d always fancied from what she d seen of my work â she knew everything i d done it appeared â that i looked deeper cared more for the way in which faces are by temperament and circumstance and of course in that sense my father s face is beautiful the c b this was even more but one could n t her divine sincerity i m afraid my one thought was to take advantage of it and i let her go on perceiving that if i wanted to paint all i had to do was to listen she poured out her heart it waa a glorious thing for a girl she said was n t it to be associated with such a life as that she felt it so strongly sometimes that it oppressed her made her shy and stupid she was so afraid people would expect her to live up to him but that was absurd of course brilliant men so seldom had clever children still â did know â she would have been happier much happier if he hadn t been in public hfe if he and she could have hidden themselves away somewhere with their books and music and she could have had it all to herself his cleverness his learning his immense unbounded goodness for no one knew how good he was no one but herself everybody recognized his cleverness his abilities even his enemies had to admit his extraordinary intellectual gifts and hated him the worse of course for the admission but no one no one could guess what he was at home she had heard of great men who were always giving performances in but whose wives and daughters saw only the empty theatre with the out and the scenery i the but with him it was just the the portrait other way wonderful as he was in public in society she felt he was n t doing justice â be was so much more wonderful at home it was like carrying a guilty secret about with her his friends his admirers would never ,11
your scotch ancestors you are a slave to the of your grandmother and your grand you obey them but do we not inherit our reason just as much as we inherit our feelings they had argued that point she could not remember what his argument was but she remembered that she had held her ground that he had her not forgetting however to take the credit of the improvement in her intellectual to himself which indeed was no more than just she would have been nothing without him how he had altered she had come to think and feel like him she often caught herself saying exactly by what he would say in certain and having heard him say how affected him she had tried to acquire a like sensibility unconsciously she had a great deal that little trick of his using his eyes a certain way that knowing little glance of his had become habitual to her she had met men who were more profound never anyone whose mind was more alert more amusing and sufficient for every occasion she a moment and then remembered further they now ate the same dishes and no longer had need to consult each other before ordering dinner in their first week in paris she had learnt to look forward to in the morning before she got up and this taste was to her for it reminded her of him in the picture galleries she had always tried to pick out the pictures he would like if they could not decide how a passage should be sung or were in doubt regarding the attitude and gesture best fitted to carry on a dramatic action she had noticed that if they separated so that they might arrive at individual conclusions they almost always happened upon the same to each other they now affected not to know from whom a certain quaint notion had come â clearly it had been inspired by him but which had first expressed it was not sure â that the three great type were and the of and la h nor were they sure which had first suggested that in the last week of her stage career she should appear in all three parts as la h would set musical london by the ears she had often wondered whether by having absorbed so much of s character she had proved herself deficient in character maintained on the contrary that the sign of genius is the power of and that which is necessary to the development of he mentioned s life which he said was but the tale of a long of ideas the narrow barren soul is narrow and barren because it cannot acquire we come into the world with nothing in our own right except the capacity for the acquisition of ideas we cannot invent ideas we can only gather some of those in circulation since the beginning of the world we them with the colour and form of our time and if that by colour and form be of supreme quality the work is preserved as representative of a period in the history of a name may or may not be attached to each specimen genius is merely the power of only the fool he would go still further he maintained that if the circumstances of a man s life admitted the acquisition of only one set of ideas his work was thin but if on the contrary circumstances threw him in the way of a new set of ideas a set of ideas different from the first set yet sufficiently near for the same brain to then the work produced by that brain would be endowed with richer colour or in form the idea was he said to a work of art what salt is to meat â it preserved works of art against the action of time how they had talked i how they had discussed things i they had talked about everything and she remembered all he said as she recalled the arguments he had used the scene of this last conversation passed and in vanishing â on the they had stopped there on their way to where she was going to sing the maidens and their gold the fire surrounding the death of the hero the end of the legends these she knew but of she knew nothing â the story or the music the time was for him to tell it the flame of the candle burnt in the still midnight and she had listened with breath she could see leaning forward telling the story and she could even see her own listening face as he related how the poor fool rises through of faith and of doubt how he the sick king with the sacred spear and becomes himself the high priest of the it had seemed to that she had been carried beyond the limits of earthly things the thrill and shiver of the dead man s genius haunted the liquid ripple of the river the moment was the deep night was full of the haunting ripple of the and she remembered how she had clasped her hands her very words came back to her it is wonderful and we are listening to the we shall never forget this midnight at that moment the bell rang and she re by why she had stayed in church she wished to discover what remnant or of her early faith still clung about her she wished to put her to the test she wondered if at the moment of she would be compelled to bow her head the bell rang again she grew tremulous with expectation she strove to refrain but her head bowed a little and her thoughts

when i did i was again out of work and seriously meditated seeking employment at something else than but the winter was a hard one and business in new york to an extent not now conceivable i think it was early in when a cold snap of severity closed the and sent up the price of coal at a bound to s per ton the coat of necessaries of life took a kindred but less considerable elevation our city stood as if till spring relieved her and it was much the same every winter aud lived awhile on the scanty of the preceding summer and autumn then on such credit as they could from and till weather brought them work again the of good did not average per week in â while they are now double that sum and living not twice as dear as it then was meat may possibly be but bread is not fuel is not clothing is not while travel is cheaper and our little liave enabled working men to live two or three miles from their work without serious cost or inconvenience thus bringing or green point practically as near to maiden lane or broad street as or the ward was winter is dull now but not nearly so aa it formerly was in spite of an and high taxes it is easier now for a working man to earn his living in new

the forms of the first number into the hands of the in an upper story in street the concern to wall street the next march finding a very near the present site of the merchants exchange and i clung to it through the spring and summer its francis v story being nearly of my own age and my devoted friend but the and were also quite young they were inexperienced in their calling without capital or influential friends recently drifted from the country to the city much as i did and their paper did not pay â i know it was difficult to make it pay me â especially through the dreary summer of the disease was then new to the civilized world while the accounts of its recent in the far east were calculated to the heart the season was the filthy and the water we drank such as should breed a at any time new york had long enjoyed and deserved the reputation of having worse water than any other city of its size on earth and the loose sands whereon it was built rendered this more and more detestable aa the city grew larger and older i am glad tliat it was my privilege to vote soon afterward for the introduction of the â which i did right heartily a good many opposed it some of them brandy two of the wards mainly by poor men giving against it twelve years that vote and our to welcome the actual introduction of the water â the we drew from the growing steadily more and more repulsive and but the glad day came at last and new york has ever since been a more eligible residence for rich or poor than it previously was we have had and other since but our city has never since been as it was in the summer of those who could mainly left us any one entered the city trade was dead and industry lai my first experiences in new york during that fatal summer i think i met two if not three bearing to hospital in my short walk from dinner in street to my â work in wall street one died at my boarding house i believe nearly all experienced of the plague though it was most common and moat fatal with those by or some form of excess but it passed off as evenings came on our and our business came back to us and all save the dead and the as before in october i paid a visit providence and boston to my relatives in new walking over the lower part of that state from into eastern and as far north as which i entered after dark of a stormy evening having walked from nine miles in a rain at gentle but steadily increasing to the last i never enter a stranger a private house if i can avoid it and i kept to see a sign until i w us so wet that it was of no consequence when at last i reached the village where i expected but failed to find an uncle living it proved to be court week with the two crowded to overflowing making my way through a thick cloud of tobacco smoke to tiie office of one i procured a remnant of supper and part of bed in a private house at some distance where i threw off ij wet clothes and slept in the morning my clothes all to the call to duty till it came to my short boots utterly refused until i had taken off my wet and them into my pockets when the boots were barely to resume their only serviceable position i took paid my bill and walked off in the frosty morning considerably than one should be at one od twenty i never saw this new be â oi and have not seen it since my relatives being pretty widely scattered i had occasion new in various

have an tumble down aspect such as i have observed nowhere else this side of lower italy on the whole i doubt whether this portion of france has improved much within the last fifty years the capital of ancient is the fifth city of france only paris and having more inhabitants here the railroad for from that to which we to is interesting for its including several venerable and richly adorned churches which i had no time to visit on the channel has a small harbor completely and inhabitants it is considerably resorted to for sea bathing but seems to have very little trade i judge that the now being extended through france are likely to arrest the growth or hasten the decline of most of the smaller cities and towns by and access to the capital where nearly every frenchman would live if he could and where the genius of people and o â t ki â at europe what constitution to all the intellectual and artistic life of the nation the railroad from new haven to london passes through no considerable town though not far from and the country is and beautiful mainly devoted to grass wheat and wood and in the very highest condition it is now toward the end of and the wheat is just beginning to though that of central italy was mainly a full month ago but the english wheat covers the ground thickly and and promises a large average crop especially if the present fine weather

thorough and aspect which i have rarely observed elsewhere is as careful and as productive but its of or grass with are by no means so frequent nor so picturesque as i see here the sturdy hospitable trees of an english park or lawn are not so far as i have seen on the continent i have rarely seen a reach of country better disposed effect than that from a point ten miles this side of new haven to within some ten miles of this city where market regular farming women work in the fields at this w n in england but not more than one woman to five men were visible in the hay fields we passed this

scant half allowance of english among them and their to understand the signs c were interesting london stout displayed in three foot letters across the front of a drinking house arrested their

but this only increased his perplexity stout signified robust hearty vigorous resolute c but what then could london stout be he closed his book at length in despair and resumed his observations london at london is given to late hours at a m though the sun has long been up there are few stirring in the principal streets occasionally you meet a cab hurrying with some passenger to take an early train but few shutters are down at and scarcely an is to be seen till after the aristocratic dinner hour is p m though i trust few are so to themselves as to their chief meal to that late hour when they have no company the morning to sleep the afternoon to business and the evening to enjoyment seems the usual routine with the favored classes walking home from a at the west end through street and the strand once at midnight i was struck though accustomed to all manner of late hours in new york with the relative activity and aspect of london at that hour it seemed the high change of and pleasure seeking the the clubs and drinking shops betrayed no symptoms â f the theatres were at n lo jn at their multitudes the and private carriages were more plentiful than by day and were briskly hundreds from party to party even the rattled down the wide streets as and almost as as at midday the were alert on nearly every corner and suspicious characters stepped about the cross streets in quest of

no longer awed by the police to the compassion of the stranger and pour its tale of woe and suffering into the rarely willing ear serene and silvery in the clear night air rose the nearly full moon

expectation that my next absence would be a long one i divided with him my and with in my pocket and very little extra clothing in my i set my face toward new york it was now â dry and hot i had but one friend on my rather long route and i resolved to pay him a visit he lived at nearly forty miles westward of and i traversed on foot the dusty ridge road eastward from the day before i reached him that day was quite hot and the water i was incessantly compelled to drink seemed very hard by nightfall i fancied that it had covered my mouth and throat with a scale like that often found a long used tea kettle the region was gently rolling and very fertile but i should have more enjoyed a over new england hills and rocks by draughts from new england and springs it was saturday night when i reached my friend and i remained with him tiu afternoon when we down to the canal and waited long for a boat none came till after nightfall when i dismissed my friend confident that a boat must soon appear after waiting in vain till near midnight i started down the tow path and walked through the darkness to some fifteen miles repeatedly the head light of a boat moving westward came in sight when i was obliged to plunge down the often rugged off bank of the tow path to avoid being caught by the tow line and hauled into the not quite transparent and inviting drink though the made that night short it seemed to me quite long and i very gladly hailed and at a boat eastward my sleepy tendencies amused my fellow passengers thence to to whom sunday night afforded a ready and natural explanation xl my in new york reaching from by line boat â my sixth and last on the raging canal â i about p m and took the for i think a railroad between the two cities first and last named was completed soon afterward but i believe not a mile of iron track was then in the state if in fact anywhere in america save the little affair constructed to freight granite from the at mass to boston night fell when i was about half way over so i sought rest in one of the many indifferent that then lined the in question and was directed to sleep in an room through which people were passing i declined and gathering up my handful of walked on half a mile farther i found another tavern not quite so and managed to stay in it tiu morning when i rose and walked on to having never been in that city before i missed the nearest way to the day boat and when i reached the landing it was two or three on its way to new york having left at a m i had no choice but to wait for another which started at a m a on either side and reached in twenty hours the where i after a good view of the city as we passed it down the river landed near at a m new york was then about one third of her present size but her business was not one fourth so great as now and her real size â counting her and considering the of thousands who find employment in and earn here recollections of a busy life though sleeping outside of her limits â was not one fifth that of no single railroad pointed her no line of ocean brought passengers to her hotels nor goods to her from any foreign port in the world her relative rank was higher but her absolute importance was scarcely greater than that of or san is to day still to my eyes which had never till yesterday gazed on a city of even inhabitants nor seen a sea going vessel her miles square of mainly brick or stone houses and her of and yards afforded ample to a wonder and admiration akin to awe it was if i recollect aright the th of august i was twenty years old the preceding february tall slender pale and with ten dollars in my pocket summer clothing worth perhaps aa much more nearly all on my back and a decent knowledge of so much of the art of as a boy will usually learn in the ofi ce of a country newspaper but i knew no human being within two hundred and my rustic manner and address did not favor that immediate command of employment which was my most urgent need however the world was all before me my personal estate tied up in a pocket handkerchief did not at all me and i stepped lightly off the boat and away from the detested hiss of escaping steam walking into and up broad street in quest of a boarding house i found and entered one at or near the comer of wall but the price of board given me was s per week so i did not need the s candidly kind suggestion that i would probably prefer one where the charge was more moderate wandering thence i cannot say how to the north river side i halted next at west street where the sign of boarding on a edifice fixed my attention i entered and was shelter and at per week which seemed more rational and i closed the bargain my host was mr edward his place quite as much shop as boarding house but it was quietly decently my first experiences in new york kept while i stayed in it and he and hia family were kind and friendly i regret to add that liquor proved his ruin not many years afterward my first day in new york was a friday and the family being catholic no meat was eaten or provided which ,8

sticking to his task instead of sacrificing it to any ideal of personal it was this gradual process of that saved him from the which falls on the active man when the sources of his activity are having accepted his fate having consented to see in himself merely the necessary agent of a good to be done he could escape from self questioning only by shutting himself up in the practical of his work closing his eyes and his thoughts to everything which had formerly related it to a wider world had given meaning and beauty to life as a whole the return from europe and the taking up of the daily routine at were the most difficult phases in process of moral s departure had at first brought relief he had been too sincere with himself to oppose her wish to leave for a time since he believed that for her as well as for himself a temporary separation would be less painful than a continuance of their actual relation but as the weeks passed into months he found he was no nearer to a dear view of his own case the future was still dark and s desire to leave him had revived his distrust of her what could it mean but that there were thoughts within her which could not be at rest in his presence he had given her every proof of his wish to forget the past and mr had behaved with yet s was evident she could not conceal her longing to escape from the conditions her act had created was it because in reality she was conscious the fruit of the tree of other motives than the one she acknowledged she had insisted almost as it might have seemed on the abstract of what she had done on the fact that speaking her act could not be made less right less by the special accidental consequences that had flowed from it because these consequences had caught her in a web of tragic she would not be guilty of the weakness of tracing back the disaster to any error in her original motive why then if this was her real her proud attitude toward the past â and since those about her believed in her sincerity and accepted her justification as from her point of view if not from theirs â why had she not been able to maintain her posture to carry on life on the terms she had from others a special circumstance contributed to this feeling of distrust the fact namely that a week after her departure from had written to say that she could not from that moment till her return consent to accept any money from as her manner was she put her reasons clearly and without hi or since you and i she wrote have always agreed in regarding the money as a kind of for our services at the mills i cannot be satisfied to go on drawing that while i am unable to do any work in return i am sure you must feel as i do about this and you need have no anxiety as to the practical side of the question since i have enough to live on in some from my hospital days which were invested for me two years ago by harry and the fruit of the tree are beginning to bring in a small return this being the case i feel i can afford to interpret in any way i choose the terms of the bargain between m and on reading this s mind had gone through the strange process which now marked all his judgments of his wife at first he had fancied he understood her and had felt that he should have done as she did then the usual reaction of distrust set in and he asked himself why she who had so little of the conventional attitude toward money should now develop this unexpected and so the old question presented itself in another shape if she had nothing to reproach herself for why was it intolerable to her to live on s money the fact that she was doing no actual service at did not account for her scruples â she would have been the last person to think that a sick servant should be of his pay her reluctance could come only from that hidden cause of which had prompted her departure and which now forced her to even the merely material links between herself and her past on his return to had tried to find in these considerations a reason for his deep it was his wife s course which still cast a doubt on what he had his will to accept and put behind him and he now told himself that the perpetual sense of her absence was due to this uneasy consciousness of what it meant of the dark secrets it enveloped and held back from him in actual truth every of his being missed her he lacked her at every turn she had been at once the the of the tree partner of his task and the pays into which he escaped from it the thought which gave meaning to the life he had chosen yet never let him forget that there was a larger richer life outside to which he was rooted by deeper and more things than any abstract ideal of his love had preserved his identity saved him from shrinking into the mere nameless which the social is in danger of becoming unless the passion is balanced and a little by a merely human one and now this was lost forever and his deepest pain lay in that he could not regain it even by casting off and choosing the but richer individual existence that her love might once have offered his life was in truth one not two united self and other self were from the roots â whichever ,11

he appeared fatigued in the previous he had made in speaking during ms journey and was very mr pierce however most impressed his he was earnest and before so vast an we here the words of his speech sir â i return you an behalf of of my who are with me and on my own my warm and thanks for the reception jou have pleased to to us i have come sir to testify the interest i feel io and the i entertain for this great and calculated to promote all that belongs to the interest of our country you sir and thâ who have been aud are associated with you imposed upon all of us a deep debt of gratitude for your energy and in great what â ter the of you have may be i can only remark they do not appear here aud so far as i have been able to perceive they arc lost in your complete and success loud and continued everything around us reminds us that we live in an age where science of up for the admiration of the world has become to the arts and all that goes to promote our prosperity sir if you had achieved do other good but that which you have in bringing together in metropolis citizens from all parts of tbe union you have fulfilled perhaps one of the most important of â that of and that union great applause but you have done more and you have nobly alluded to it your exhibition has been the means of bringing here from all the civilized countries on the lace of the globe men most eminent in all the walks of life and thus you have done than could be done in almost any other manner o promote that great object dear to you dear to me and dear to my venerable friend near me bishop peace mid good wiu among men applause i have not the voice at tliis lime to address you at any greater length aud by again to you my thanks for your generous reception and my heart s best for the of your enterprise applause mr when the president had finished proposed three cheers for the president which given no other speeches were made but various pieces of music were sung and played by the army of artists present the effect of these was magnificent at one moment a march the great e ti s in the force time painting the tread of armed and hosts this its ei had died and ceased to their e tl e and the soaring dome would le responded to bj another band pouring forth some w full of youth and love and the of early hearts and gentle hands then these of the earth would cease and the religious idea of the glories of art would as the chorus came with tht effect of a of singers through typical of the of the soul boundless and sublime and shouting the old church words and music â as adopted by the genius of the aiid turned into on the opening in upon such an it would be a grateful task to us to speak with praise of all the proceedings but we feel it a duty to make an exception and one of the most positive and force we do not in these remarks make much account of the crystal palace and its contents not being ready let any one enter the premises and see the apparently infinite detail of beams pillars arches glass tints and add tâ that the care trouble and calculation to place in their proper positions and their best phases all the goods from six thousand and the vulgar complaint against the place and its not being ready will be swallowed up in admiration of the and general splendor of the scene of its beauty there is but one opinion gen pierce and all those who came witb him seeing it for the first time were evidently thrilled with delight no words are too strong for admiration first for messrs and the of the crystal palace and then for mr and the gentlemen connected with him in the elaborate and difficult work of under these circumstances the triumph of the scene so thorough and so far exceeding expectations must silence all reflections on the d as to the time of the exhibition and the public agreed the with the president when he would not admit of the existence of as regarded the aspects of the scene our objections he in another way and we explain them we hold that the palace is if anything the most eminent tribute to art and industry that this country and this century can pay we hold its should have been the on i or artists and to occupy the highest representative seats on the platform but both were ab v ignored by the committee of we saw fighting men in abundance and place but not a single man eminent for tha arts which tlie crystal palace was opened to at the opening of the crystal palace of london although it was a purely exhibition clergy soldiers and occupying the seats of honor and the working men who built and the wonderful edifice were kept hke slave artists and in the back ground of caste yet there even amid the of state mr the genius who it to hfe was on the platform but we would ask where were the of our palace messrs and why were they not on the platform what had any personage or the doctor this or that to do in the face of the m w th the men who created the edifice which and all yesterday was their and they should have been seen and heard but true to the of thin country every one overlooked them thej v ere not mentioned m terms they wore not greeted by the oi ,8

her sickly sister when the day of promised pleasure is at hand and she begins to fear her sister s cough will render it impossible to go from home the pain in your foot my love is considerably better says the wife to her husband when she thinks the are about leaving bath you are looking extremely well says the niece to her aged uncle who has promised to take her to paris â i think i never saw you look so well but all this is not love it does not feel like love to the parties addressed for nature is true to herself and she will betray the secrets of art how different are the workings of that deep and earnest affection that sees with one glance how unreasonable it would be to drag forth the invalid to any in the of health and how welcome is the gentle whisper which us that one watchful eye our suffering one ear in our weakness and distress for it w distress to be compelled to complain that we are unequal to do what the happiness of others depends upon our doing and never is the voice of friendship employed in a more kindly office than when pleading the cause of our infirmity of it is chiefly with regard to the two sister virtues of and kindness that i look upon the women of england as so highly privileged because the nature of their social and domestic circumstances is such as to afford them constantly opportunities of proving that they think often and kindly of others without any departure from the routine of their conduct that might wear the character of a pointed application of such feelings it has a startling and by no means an agreeable effect upon the mind when a woman who is not habitually accustomed to any sort of practical kindness so far from her usual line of conduct as to perform any personal service solely for ourselves we feel that she has been troubled and suspect that she has been annoyed but women accustomed to practical duties are able to turn the whole tide of their affectionate solicitude into channels so wholesome and that our pride is not wounded by the obligation under which we are placed nor is our sense of gratitude by the pain of being out as the object of unwonted and elaborate attentions in order to illustrate the subject by a familiar instance let us imagine one of those events experienced by all who have lived to years of maturity and experienced in such a way as to have thrown them in a peculiar manner upon the domestic comforts of the circle to which they were the arrival after long travel on a visit to an early and highly valued friend it is not necessary to this picture that park gates should be thrown open and stationed on the steps of the domestic habits of hall it will better serve our purpose that the mistress of the house should herself be the first to meet her guest with that genuine welcome in her looks and manner that leaves nothing to be expressed by words we will suppose that with her own hand she all the of extra rendered necessary by the winter s and having quietly dismissed the expectant or porter she leads her friend into the neatly furnished parlour where another and a more familiar welcome seems at once to throw open her heart and her house for her reception a fire that has been built up is then most stirred until a bright and genial blaze its light around the room and the guest begins to glow with the two fold warmth of a welcome and a winter s fire in the mean time the servant well taught in the mysteries of hospitality the luggage up stairs unseen and the guest is led to the chamber appointed for her nightly rest there most especially is both seen and felt the kind feeling that has taken into account her peculiar tastes and anticipated all her well remembered wishes the east or the west apartment has been chosen according to the preference she has been known to express in days long since gone by when she and her friend were girls together and thus the chain of fond and cherished tions is made to appear again unbroken after the lapse of years and a conviction is silently impressed upon the mind of the perhaps the most welcome of all earthly sources of that we have been remembered not merely in the but that through long l the women of england years of change and separation time has not from the mind of a dear friend the slightest trace of our individuality perhaps none can tell until they have arrived at middle age what is in reality the essential sweetness of this in our association with the world we may have obtained for our industry our usefulness or it may be for our talents a measure of approval at least with our deserts but give back to the worn and the weary in this world s war re the friends of their early the friends who loved them faults and all â the friends who could note down their very follies without contempt and who attached a degree of interest and importance to the trifling peculiarities of their temper and feelings which rendered them of an attachment such as never can be formed in after life to return from this â the english woman in the beauty of her character has a power far surpassing what can be attained by the most scrupulous of the rules of art of thus her familiar and social actions with a charm that goes directly to the heart we have traced the traveller to the chamber of her rest and it is not in the choice of this room alone but in its furniture and general aspect ,7
wanted me to get you to come she says she s sure you will up the meeting with your knowledge of books and writings english poetry is our topic today so put on your english poetry really love to go i didn t realize you were reading poetry oh we re not so slow mrs wife of the richest man in town at them when they appeared her expensive frock of colored satin with rows and of solemn brown beads was intended for a woman twice her size she stood wringing her hands in front of nineteen folding chairs in her front parlor with its faded photograph of falls in its colored of mr its lamp painted with cows and mountains and standing on a marble column she o mrs vm in such a fix i m supposed to lead the discussion and i wondered would you come and help what poet do you take up today demanded in her library tone of what book do you wish to take out why the english ones not all of them w why yes we re learning all of european literature this year the club gets such a nice magazine culture and we follow its last year our subject was men and women of the bible and next year we ll probably take up and china my it does make a body to keep up with all these new culture subjects but it is improving so will you help us with the discussion today on her way over had decided to use the as the tool with which to the town she had conceived enormous enthusiasm she had these are the real people when the who bear the burdens are interested in poetry it means something ill work with them â for them â anything her enthusiasm had become watery even before thirteen women resolutely removed their sat down ate their fingers folded their hands composed their lower thoughts and invited the naked muse of poetry to deliver her most improving message they had greeted affectionately and she tried to be a daughter to them but she felt her chair was out in the open exposed to their gaze and it was a hard slippery church parlor chair likely to publicly and without warning it was impossible to sit on it without folding the hands and listening she wanted to kick the chair and run it would make a magnificent clatter she saw that was watching her she pinched her wrist as though she were a noisy child in church and when she was decent and cramped again she listened mrs opened the meeting by sighing i m sure fm glad to see you all here today and i understand that the ladies have prepared a number of very interesting papers this is such an interesting subject the poets they have been an inspiration for higher thought in fact wasn t it reverend who said that some of the poets have been as much an inspiration as a good many of the ministers and so we shall be glad to hear the poor lady smiled panted with fright about the small oak table to find her eye glasses and continued we will first have the pleasure of hearing mrs on the subject shakespeare and milton main street mrs said that shakespeare was born in and died he lived in london england and in on which many american loved to visit a lovely town with many and old houses well worth examination many people believed that shakespeare was the greatest who ever lived also a fine poet not much was known about his life but after all that did not really make so much difference because they loved to read his numerous plays several of the best known of which she would now perhaps the best known of his plays was the merchant of having a beautiful love story and a fine appreciation of a woman s brains which a woman s club even those who did not care to themselves on the question of ought to appreciate laughter mrs was sure that she for one would love to be like the play was about a jew named and he didn t want his daughter to marry a gentleman named mrs a slender gray nervous president of the and wife of reported the birth and death dates of scott and wound up was quite a poor boy and he did not enjoy the advantages we enjoy today except for the advantages of the fine old scotch where he heard the word of god preached more than even in the finest big brick churches in the big and so called advanced cities of today but he did not have our advantages and latin and the other treasures of the mind so richly strewn before the alas too feet of our youth who do not always sufficiently appreciate the privileges freely granted to every american boy rich or poor had to work hard and was sometimes led by evil companionship into low habits but it is morally instructive to know that he was a good student and educated himself in striking contrast to the loose ways and so called aristocratic society life of lord on which i have just spoken and certainly though the lords and of his day may have looked down upon as a humble person many of us have greatly enjoyed his pieces about the mouse and other rustic subjects with their message of humble beauty â i am so sorry i have not got the time to quote some of them mrs george gave ten minutes to and mrs a faced curiously sweet woman so awed by her that wanted to kiss her completed the day s grim task by a paper on other poets the other poets worthy of consideration were gray mrs and miss obliged with a recital of the and from by request she gave an old sweetheart ,9
of a current passing between in a liquid if one be of very small area the of gas formed tend to collect on it and thus interrupt the continuous passage of the current then almost these are dissipated

of mechanical in use in practice the of small area is the and is composed of while the consists of a lead plate of large area in is commonly used though apparatus other have been suggested as more suitable for certain purposes a call containing such and having in it two ae described represents the total of the break though many of have been introduced an arrangement which probably the utmost extent of consistent with and economy in regular work might consist of a large sized glass cell having in the a of from with lead cover the bottom end of which a wire projects to an extent by a screw at its upper end and having further a in the form of a sheet of lead of suitable size the triple type illustrated in fig is now generally used as it a much wider range of and in combination with the winding of the than the single type just described as further the simplicity in of this form of break we represent in fig and describe one which may be made for himself by anyone who has even hat practical x ray work slight manual dexterity and that for a few pence or at most a few an ordinary or glass jar may be used as a containing â the larger the better through the closed end of a test seal a short length of wire and into the to a height of inch or more through a wooden cover to the cell or in some other suitable manner as in fig c the test deeply in the and to make connection dip a wire from the home positive pole of the source of supply into the then bang over the edge of the cell a piece of sheet lead reaching to near the bottom of the and having a screw at its upper end to bind a connecting wire from the negative pole of the source and your break is complete a break so constructed we know from experience to work very satisfactorily and it can be renewed many times for the cost of one of the more elaborate breaks put on the market which will give little if any better results with breaks the of interruption will apparatus i vary according to the pressure of current supplied higher producing more rapid interruption by exposing a larger area of the to the the rate of interruption is reduced and by exposing less the rate is the increased area of exposure allows a higher to pass with the suspended from separate of wood glass or other material as shown in fig some of the action may be secured by moving the two to various distances apart for working with this form of break an with short winding should be employed since the of longer prevents the full effect of the break s special reaching the x ray the of the should in all cases with these breaks be put out of circuit in action and especially with heavy currents of high pressure breaks are very noisy so the whole cell and should be in felt to the sound and the break should be kept in a separate closed room where possible with heavy work the becomes very soon heated and operation of the break is thereby embarrassed and later stopped a cell of large capacity should therefore be employed to delay the effect and that may be set into a larger vessel containing cold water if continuous heavy work is expected the require no cleaning which is a great convenience for use with currents of small quantity and low as from these breaks are they require for efficient working a current of about or more will not work under and work best between and unless for specially strong currents indeed such a break is not advisable since its action is not enough to commend it for ordinary purposes for i hich other breaks may serve it is important that an should be connected correctly the to the positive pole of the source if connected otherwise the will gradually practical x ray work or possibly if thin and the will not work well if the direction of be correct the sparks in the have a red if wrong

already referred to in the introduction to this chapter and some of the conditions of their working we do not propose to enter into any detail of their theory or construction since those will be found sufficiently described in any modern text book on a few notes on their practical working are to this chapter for the convenience of workers not familiar with them the forms however a most important part of an x ray and it is advisable that every should make himself thoroughly acquainted with its theory and practical working for our present purpose it is sufficient to recall that its function

national history wherein northern resistance to slavery extension ever won in a fair stand up contest without compromise or nine weeks had been spent â i think not â in producing this result and there were not over seventy five decided in the house of members in which it was achieved day after day those who stiu insisted on holding on to banks recollections of a busy life had been against as the cause for their when in fact had banks been dropped it would have been found impossible to so many on any one else as were nearly or quite a times cast for liim the readiness of his friends at all times to adopt the rule and abide the result them from all just reproach as the contest if were needed it became the of the administration to let the house be oi under that rule so that the public

waves of party passion ran very high i believe but one of the many made by him as speaker was and the house on calmer consideration its vote men may have filled that difficult post but no man i judge ever gave himself more to the discharge of its duties i have heard that mr banks was a in his youth and his manner in the chair often the tradition if he had a fault it was that of impelled by

branches of trees showing but little sign of decay occur at a height of about a hundred feet above tide in camp at bay water i have not yet compared this wood with that of the opposite shore that the was once withdrawn considerably back of its present limit seems plain immense torrents of water had filled in the with material and for centuries favorable conditions allowed forests to grow upon it at length the advanced probably three or four miles and burying the trees which had grown undisturbed for centuries then came a great which produced the flood that deposited the trees also the trees which grew around the shores above reach of floods were shed off perhaps by the of the soil that was resting on the buried margin of the left on its retreat and protected by a covering of material from melting as fast as the exposed surface of the what appear to be of the margin of the when it stood at a much higher level still exist on the left side and probably all along its banks on both sides just below its present june we fixed a mark on the left wing to measure the motion if any it rained all day but i had a grand tramp over mud ice and rock to the east wall of the brown slate close in places away from the presenting edges to ice action which has given rise to a singularly beautiful and striking surface polished and and all the next day it rained the mountains were travels in smothered in dull colored mist and fog the great through the gloomy gray fog with wonderful effect the thunder of and through the atmosphere it is bad weather for exploring but delightful nevertheless making all the strange mysterious region yet stranger and more mysterious june a light rain we were visited by two parties of indians a man from each came ashore leaving the women in the to guard against the waves i tried my and made out to say that i wanted to hire two of them in a few days to go a little way back on the and around the bay they are seal hunters and promised to come again with who hi boston â knew well how to speak english i saw three huge born spray rose about two hundred feet lovely reflections showed of the pale blue tones of the ice wall and mountains in the calm water are common making the along the shore look like the sheer wall of the from which they were discharged i am watching the ice wall life and behavior etc yesterday and to day a solitary small was feeding about camp a on the shore ducks and a few of each and a bald eagle are all the birds i have noticed thus far the is thundering in camp at bay june clearing clouds and sunshine in less than a minute i saw three large born first there is usually a preliminary thundering of comparatively small masses as the large mass begins to fall then the grand crash and boom and roaring three or four heavy main throbbing and are heard as the main mass falls in several pieces and also secondary and as the mass or masses plunge and rise again and again ere they come to rest seldom if ever do the towers and into which the front of the is broken fall forward headlong from their like falling trees at the or above or below it they mostly sink or nearly so as if by the melting action of the water of the occasionally maintaining their upright position after sinking far below the level of the water and rising again a hundred feet or more into the air with water streaming like hair down their sides from their crowns then forward and fall flat with yet another thundering report raising spray in magnificent and sheets occasionally to the very top of the front wall by the sun the spray and crystal masses are beautiful some of the pour in fragments from in the wall like white and looking even dusty with minute ice followed by a rushing succession of thunder tones into a huge blunt solemn roar most of these crumbling are from the excessively shattered central travels in part of the ice wall the solid deep blue masses from the ends of the wall forming the large rise from the bottom of the many lesser reports are heard at a distance of a mile or more from the fall of into or from the opening of new the are very irregular from three to twenty two an hour on one rising tide six hours there were sixty discharged large enough to thunder and be heard at distances of from three quarters to one and a half miles and on one succeeding falling tide six hours sixty nine were discharged july j we were awakened at four o clock this morning by the whistle of the steamer george w elder i went out on the and waved my hand in salute and was answered by a from the whistle soon a party came ashore and asked if i was professor the leader professor harry of introduced himself and his companion mr also of and six or eight young students who had come well provided with instruments to study the they landed seven or eight tons of freight and pitched camp be side ours i am delighted to have companions so congenial â we have now a village as i set out to climb the second mountain three thousand feet high on the east side of the i met many returning from a walk on the smooth east margin of the and had to answer many questions i had a hard climb but wonderful in camp at bay views were

a good dinner when it is set before them and a very large class including all the ladies who are only about its looking good i some private views do not care whether it is good or bad in private life if a dinner consists of many courses is given at a fine house and is expensive of those who sit down to it are satisfied the twentieth alone says to himself how much better i should have dined at home t i have been at scores and scores of great dinner parties where the very plates were cold and nobody but myself has observed it i have no doubt the gentleman of fashion was right delicate cooking would be entirely thrown away upon the general the fair sex the young the hungry the easy going the ignorant â a majority of the of hotels do these classes embrace and it must also be remarked that to cook food except delicately in large quantities is a very difficult operation upon the whole i think our large hotels arranged on the continental system are well adapted for those who frequent them and they show a readiness to adopt improvements an immense number of well to do people go to to and scores of other places to get a change and fresh air but also to find the same amusements to which they have been accustomed in london and on the whole they get what they want without paying very much too much for it but what drives many quiet folks abroad is their to meet with all this gaiety and public life they do not mind it so much when it is mixed with the foreign element and they are also under the impression that picturesque scenery is a peculiarity of the continent i believe that more hotels english people have visited than have seen the lake district and the channel islands and very many more than have travelled in north and the chief reason of their in this respect is however their dread of the want of accommodation to the last two with the exception of some towns such as by sea or a direct railway route folks never go in crowds and never will go it is true there are no hotels to be found there but for picturesque situation and a certain homely comfort that takes one not only into another world but another generation there is nothing equal to certain little in these out of the way places in wales also and even in the isle of there are perfect of bliss of this description still by the not ten years ago in a part of north which shall nameless i came with my wife and daughter upon an inn of this description we were all with the exquisite beauty of its situation and were so as to express in the presence of the landlady our wish to live and die there well indeed sir she said i am delighted to see you but i hope you are not going to stay very long my dear madam i remonstrated aghast at this remark are we then such very persons bless your heart no sir it isn t that but the fact is we have only room for three and if parties come and come and always find us full through your being here you know they will think it is no use coming and v e shall lose our custom we did stay on however a pretty long time â it was a some private views place of beauty such as one parts from almost with tears â and when on our departure i asked for my bill the landlady said dear me sir would you kindly tell me what day you come upon for i ha lost my account of it the life we led at that inn was purely pastoral the cream was of that that it was meat and drink in one but although the fare was homely it was good of its kind and admirably cooked there was fresh fish every day â for we were too far from for that the london market to deprive us of it â and tender fowls and of all kinds such as no money could buy the landlady had a genius for making what she called and every cupboard in the queer little house was filled with them in the sitting room was a quantity of old china and brought by the sailors of the place from foreign lands the linen was white as snow and smelt of outside the inn was a sea that stretched to and cliffs that caught the sunset â such scenery as is not surpassed by that of the though of course in a very different line and be sure i was afraid of no comparison between our travellers rest and any inn it is that this of ours was so peculiarly and placed that it could only be approached on foot which reminds me of another place of entertainment for man but not for beast in appearance the strangers welcome as i will take leave to term it is more ambitious than the rest but it is of the same simple type in some hotels respects it is even more primitive no sign hangs over its door nor is any other symbol of its visible liberty not license as one may say without much being its motto it is on an island so insignificant in extent that horse exercise is impossible on it what it in superficial area is more than made up however in its height from the welcome though it lies in a one looks down perhaps a hundred sheer feet upon the ocean its solemn murmur even in calm always reaches the place and when in storm its spray as one watches it from the lawn among the one scarcely knows which mood becomes it best the ,12
you d teach the older looked at and going over to the piano attempted to play her favorite who had once worked for her daily bread and earned it in a sort of way by giving music lessons smiled sadly at the girl s ignorance of life i see said who was quick to divine every shade of sentiment passing in the minds of those she loved you don t think i could teach even the little children my dear i hope it will never come to your having to try i must do something to get a living she replied looking vaguely and wistfully into the fire how unfortunate all this is â that horrid horrid old man but supposing he had asked you to marry him â he wasn t nice but fortune you are older than i aad if you had married him you would have become in a way my but what a charming i oh how i should have loved that i come it is time to go to bed you let your imagination run away with you you are not cross because no dear i m not cross i m only a little tired we have talked too long s allusion to music teaching had revived in all her most painful memories if this man were to cast them out of supposing supposing that were to happen starving days pale and haggard rose up in her memory what should she do what should she do and with that girl dependent on her for food and clothes and shelter she buried her face in the pillow and prayed that she might be saved from such a destiny fear kept her awake if this man â this unknown creature â were to refuse to help them she and would have to go to london and she would have to support as best she might the rendered things strangely distinct and she saw down the gaunt perspective of a long life vain fortune of poverty this poor delicate orphan girl with no one but her to look to for support she would hold to her and fight for her with all her strength but would she not fall in the fight and then and then the same thoughts questions and fears turned in her head like a wheel and it was not until dawn had begun to the window panes that she fell asleep a few days after the post brought a letter for after glancing hastily down the page she said this is a letter from mr and it is good news oh what a relief mrs immediately i arrived in london i set to work to find out mr price s address it was the easiest matter in the world for he has a play now running at one of the theatres so i directed my letter to the theatre and next morning i had a visit from him after explaining to him the resources of the brilliant fortune he had come i told him of his uncle s intention to add a to his will leaving miss three hundred a year i told him that this last will had left her entirely for he said at once that he fully agreed with me and that he would consider what was the most honorable course for him to take in regard to his cousin this is exactly what he said but his manner was such that before leaving he left no doubt in my mind whatever that he will act very generously indeed i should not be surprised if he settled even more than the proposed three hundred a year on miss he is a very quiet thoughtful young man of about two or three and thirty he looks poor and i fancy he has lived through very hard times he wears an air of sadness and disappointment which makes him attractive and his manners are gentle and refined i tell you these things for i know they will interest you i have not been able to find out if he is married but i am sorry to say that his play has not succeeded i should have found out more but he was not in my office above ten minutes he had to hurry away to keep an appointment at the theatre for as he explained it was to be decided that very day if the play was to be taken out of the bills at the end of the week he promised to call again and our interview is fixed for eleven o clock the day after to morrow in the meantime take heart for i think i am justified in telling you i feel quite sanguine as to the result well said laying down the letter i don t think that anything could be more satisfactory and just fancy dear old mr being able to describe a young man as well as that he t say if he is short or tall or dark or fair no he doesn t i think he might have fortune told us something about his personal but it is a great relief to hear that he is not the vulgar we have always understood him to be mr says his manners are refined you might take a fancy to him after all but you don t know that he isn t married i suppose mr wasn t able to find that out i should like to know â but not because i want to marry him or any one else only i don t like the idea of a great vulgar woman and a pack of children about the place when we go do you dislike children so much then i don t know that i ever thought about them but i m sure i shouldn t like his children i of him last night do you believe in dreams what did you dream i cannot ,3

and it was a pleasure to him to imagine his father on his balcony in good humour no doubt the weather being so favourable to fish taking now which are peter s boats among these he asked himself his eyes returning to the fishing fleet and which are john s and james s boats he could tell that all the were down by the sails crossed over for the boats were before the wind a long pull back it will be to he was thinking a matter of thirteen or fourteen miles for the leading boat is not more than a mile from the mouth of the then raising his eyes from the fishing boats he followed the coast the brook lines again seeking the shapes of the wooded hills rising in gently a more evening never breathed upon a lake he said and when he raised his eyes a second time they rested on the of far away in the north still full of the winter s snow and â being a â he knew they would keep their snow for another month at least the eagerness of the spring would then be well out of the air and i shall be

argument yet argument he did not escape from for as they rode through the open country behind some declared that was not a pure jew and to make their points clearer they often up their horses to the annoyance of joseph who could not bring the discussion to an end without seeming indifferent to the law and the traditions but happily it had to end before long for within three miles of they were riding in single ii the brook file down deep lanes along whose low the crawled itself along one lane led into another a of deep lanes wound round which judging by the number of new dwellings seemed to have since joseph had last seen it humble dwellings no doubt joseph said to himself but bread is not lacking nor fish then he thought of the his father had built for the boats and the for the making of the barrels into which the fish was packed owed its existence to dan s and he had earned his right joseph thought to live in the tall house which he had built for his pleasure in a garden amid tall trees that every breeze that blew up from the lake set in motion if ever a man joseph thought earned his right to a old age amid pleasant surroundings that man was his father and he thought of him returning from his to his spacious thinking of the barrels of salt fish that he would send away the following week if the were letting down their with fortunate enterprise chapter x a very good of his father s and thoughts was that of joseph while riding from for as the came up the lane at a the old man was homeward from his counting house wishing peter and james and john and the rest good fortune with their or else he had begun to think the order from cannot the completed sentence would probably have run cannot be executed but the sound of the of joseph s horse checked the words on his lips and he had to squeeze himself against the ditch to escape being trodden upon joseph sprang from the saddle father i haven t hurt you i hope i was dreaming why joseph it is you you haven t hurt me and i was dreaming too but what a beautiful horse you are riding aren t you afraid he will run away up and down these lanes he would give us a fine chase no joseph replied he ll follow me and the horse followed them pushing his head against joseph s shoulder from time to time but joseph was too much engaged with his father to do more than whistle to when he lingered to as we rode past i had imagined you father sitting in the drinking we will have some presently dan answered i was detained at my business tell me father how are the and the much the same as you left them dan answered as he laid his hand on the latch of the large wooden gate a servant came forward to conduct them and joseph threw his reins to him u the brook a monkey came across the and jumped on to joseph s shoulder another came and then a third dan would have been annoyed if the had not recognised joseph for it ,3

quite crazy my small she is so cold already that her hand has almost frozen mine in spite of my thick gloves would you have her to death his wife as he came up the steps had been taking another long earnest almost awe stricken gaze at the little white stranger she hardly knew whether it was a dream or no but she could not help that she saw the delicate print of violet s fingers on the child s neck it looked just as if while violet was out the image she had given it a gentle pat with her hand a childish miracle and had neglected to smooth the impression quite away after all husband said the mother to her idea that the angels would be as much delighted to play with violet and as she herself was after all she does look like a snow image i do believe she is made of snow a puff of the west wind blew against tlie snow child and again she sparkled like a star snow repeated good mr drawing the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold no wonder she looks like snow she is half frozen poor little thing but a good fire will put everything to rights without further talk and always with the same best intentions this highly benevolent and common sensible individual led the little white â drooping drooping drooping more and more â out of the frosty air and into his comfortable parlor a stove filled to the brim with intensely burning was sending a bright gleam through the of its iron door and causing the of water on its top to and with excitement a warm smell was diffused throughout the room a on the wall from the stove stood at eighty degrees the parlor was hung with red curtains and covered with a red carpet and looked just as warm as it felt the difference the atmosphere here and the cold wintry twilight out of doors was like stepping at once from to the part of india or from the north pole into an oven o this was a fine place for the little white stranger the snow image the common sensible man placed the snow child on the hearth rug right in front of the hissing and stove now she will be comfortable cried mr his hands and looking about him with the smile you ever saw make yourself at home my child sad sad and drooping looked the little white maiden as she stood on the hearth rug with the hot blast of the stove striking through her like a once she threw a glance wistfully toward the windows and caught a glimpse through its red curtains of the roofs and the stars glimmering and all the delicious intensity of the cold night the bleak wind rattled the window panes as if it were her to come forth but there stood the snow child drooping before the hot stove but the common sensible man saw nothing amiss come wife said he let her have a pair of thick stockings and a shawl or blanket directly and tell to give her some warm supper as soon as the milk you violet and amuse your little friend she is out of spirits you see at finding herself in a strange place for my part i will go around among the neighbors and find out where she belongs the mother meanwhile had gone in search of the shawl and stockings for her own view of the matter however subtle and delicate had given way as it always did to the stubborn of her husband without the of his two children who still kept murmuring that their little snow sister a childish did not love the warmth good mr took his departure shutting the parlor door carefully behind him turning up the collar of his sack oyer his ears he emerged from the house and had barely reached the street gate when he was recalled by the screams of violet and and the of a finger against the parlor window husband husband cried his wife showing her horror stricken face through the window panes there is no need of going for the child s parents we told you so father screamed violet and as he the parlor you would bring her in and now our poor â dear â beau ti ful little is and their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears so that their father seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this every day world felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to too in the utmost perplexity he demanded an explanation of his wife she could only reply that being summoned to the parlor by the cries of violet and she found no trace of the little white maiden unless it were the remains of a heap of snow which while she was gazing at it melted quite away upon the hearth rug and there you see all that is left of it added she pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove yes father said violet looking at him through her tears there is all that is left of our dear little snow sister naughty father cried stamping his foot and â i shudder to say â shaking his little fist at the tiie snow i common sensible man we told you how it would be what for did you bring her in and the stove through the of its door seemed to glare at good mr like a demon in the mischief it had done this you will observe was one of those rare cases which yet will occasionally happen where finds itself at fault the remarkable story of the snow image though to that sagacious class of people to whom good mr belongs it may seem but a childish is nevertheless capable of in various methods greatly

of the ordinary run of letters can be handled in this way a form letter should be clear and to and should give definite information it is extremely to cut a form letter so short that it that element of complete information for which the possible customer is asking it is absolutely absurd to say that form letters should be but a page in length it has been found that form letters containing as much as twenty five hundred words have proved very much more effective and profitable than letters containing but three hundred words in the mail order business the great majority of the business short cuts j d o â i â o a o t o â â â o z o z i â a i e o si o z l business short cuts business is obtained by the personality displayed in form letters personality in is the element that makes so in form letters is the element that brings orders a series of form letters covering the different of the should be arranged and and numbered in such a fashion as not to interfere with the impression that they are personally dictated as the vast majority of mail order resent being treated as a mass therefore form letters should be arranged for instance where the word dictated with the of the party and of

inquiry marks on it and hands it to a to fill in the name and address this the time of and a uniform excellence in the replies form letters and form form letters should be arranged in loose leaf scrap books and a complete set furnished to each clerk manager or handling inquiries from time to time it will be necessary to substitute new forms for old ones the old forms can easily be removed from the loose leaf book and new ones inserted form can be numbered i etc and in answering such inquiries the correspondence clerk can mark on the inquiry paragraph i which would be the ordinary form of acknowledgment and then paragraph and dealing with the subject of the inquiry and ending with paragraph which may be the ordinary form of closing the paragraph idea of course applies to a method business short cuts of answering letters where each answer is especially form letters may be printed in imitation of so cleverly done that it is almost impossible to detect the difference between the printed letter and the especially dictated letter it pays to have the letter bear all the ear marks of personal even though it means a considerable relative additional cost is the modern method of finding out just what a particular line of or what particular publication of a number is bringing the best returns from a certain advertisement there are several ways of an advertisement one is making a special offer and a to the ad requiring that the be filled out and sent in before the special offer is good this contains a statement of where the ad was taken from the idea however is only useful in comparatively large spaces such as pages or half pages in the magazines or large spaces in the newspapers the pays better in the magazines some key their by changing the street address on each ad this in case where a large number of of similar circulation are used is rather in results for the simple reason that the possible customer in answering the ad may be influenced by magazines which do not get the credit for their work and it has the additional in such cases of suspicions of possible customers others change the number of the rooms in the building which they occupy others request the possible customer to address a different department this is being used by a number of the larger concerns business short cuts probably the best way to key an ad is to make a special offer in each magazine so the offers as to give a complete index to the magazines bringing the most replies it has one important however of not putting all the magazines on the same plane up to date method for record of purchases when supplies are required a regular order is made out and the order is also entered on the loose leaf purchase record which is placed in a file with guide cards for each kind of supplies used this file is divided into three namely goods ordered goods received bills for payment when the bill is received the and are checked with the order and the date of receipt of bill is

friendship the moments are precious and you are waited for said in the course of his conference with we must strike whilst the iron is hot separated as our good friends are from each other you are now in the power and at the mercy â which is a significant phrase â of the government of your motions therefore should be prompt there are seasons in the history of every trouble when the virtue of deliberation mainly lies in its rapidity and the boldness of its resolve i you sir to regard this as such a season and to take the course which the honor of our sovereign demands without further pause to think of consequences when you were here a month ago replied i had my scruples but things have strangely altered in that short interval your standard more bravely over the path of invasion than i had deemed it possible you charged me then with being a and you may remember even my loyalty i did you a grievous wrong my dear friend and not know your generous nature as soon as it was uttered my

and he was silly enough to think he could do so and still win your daughter she should be told of this she has been told of it and she believes it not was my given to her for the truth of the fact it was and to speak plainly to you it has only made your name hateful to her ear then shall she have proof of it which she cannot doubt she shall have it in the recorded judgment of a court martial which has condemned him as a traitor and a spy she shall have it in the doom of his death and the of his estate exclaimed with a bitter proud girl u remember yourself sir interrupted sternly this is not the

wool had been able to read the newspaper another patient had been able to tell what was passing in another mind and at a distance of a mile the only explanation s that could give of this second was that the knowledge had been conveyed throng the rustling of the blood in the veins which the had enabled the patient to hear and â that this scientific explanation was more incredible than any spiritual one there was much else there was all s wonderful talk about the creation of things by thought and his to the mysterious had strangely interested her but suddenly she remembered that perchance his was allied to the black art of the and her catholic conscience was mysteriously and she experienced the attraction of terror was it possible that he believed that all the accidents or what we suppose are accidents have been earned in a preceding life did he really believe that lovers may tempt each other life after life that a group of people may come together again it is half past ten very well i will get up i will ring for you when i have had my bath lady has gone out and will not be home for lunch there was not even a letter and the day stretched out before her might call but she did not think he would she thought of a visit to her father but something held her back and was a long way after breakfast she went to the piano and sang some of s music stopping suddenly in the middle of a bar she thought she would send him a note asking him to come to lunch but what should she do till two o clock it was now only eleven suddenly it struck her that she might take a and go and see him she had never seen his rooms and to visit him there would be more amusing than for him to come to park lane and she ed his surprise and delight at seeing her her thoughts went to the frock she would wear â a new one had come home yesterday â this would be an opportunity to wear it she would take him to lunch with her at some she was in excellent humour her thoughts amused her and she reflected that she had done well to choose the pale shot silk with green shades in it it was trimmed with black lace and she selected a large black hat with black feathers to wear with it and seeing the people in the streets as she drove past she wondered if they were as happy as she was she on their errands and wondered if many of the women were g ing like her to their lovers she wondered what their lovers were like and she laughed at her thoughts seeing that she was passing through a very mean street she hoped that s rooms were not too and felt relieved when she found that the street she dreaded led into a square a square she reflected always means a certain measure of respectability and the faded old fashioned neighbourhood pleased her some of the houses seemed as if they had known more fashionable days and the square a tender melancholy it suggested a vision of dreamy lives â lived in ideas lives of students who lived in books unaware of the of things but the could not find the

that she had imagined it quite correctly and when she reached the landing to which she had been directed she stopped hearing his voice he was only talking to himself she pushed the door and called to him oh it is you he said you have come sooner than i expected then you expected me â yea i expected you expected me to day but what you saying when i came in only some he replied quite naturally but you don t really believe in such and it surely is very wrong he looked at her as he might at some beautiful apparition likely at any moment to vanish from his sight then drew her towards him and kissed her her hand was laid on his shoulder and in a delicious apprehension she stood looking at him where shall we sit he threw some books and papers from a cane chair and she lay down in it he sat on the arm and then tried to talk let me take your hat she it and he placed it on the piano his room was lighted by two square windows looking on the open space in front of the square where the children gathered in noisy groups round a dripping iron fountain the floor was covered with and near the fireplace drawn in front of the window was a large oak table covered with papers of various kinds against the end wall there was a and there were shelves filled with books there were two a piano and some prints of s illustrations to on the wall the writing table covered with manuscript music

the of the whole world came there with treasures of distant lands and when st mark s held a gorgeous from one year s end to another s in a to enjoy thoroughly one must himself into that dead and

some hundreds of feet in width during the major part of its course the streets are seldom more than twenty when an hour had passed and the sun was peeping over the rosy tints of the east the passenger

buildings that bordered the the light on the outer world had little effect as yet on these secluded passages the undisturbed quality of the voyage was if anything improved by the change so little prospect was there of another approaching from the opposite direction that s forgot to utter his usual cry at the doubtful corners love gone astray the that seemed to offer a succession of impossible turns for the long craft proved equal to its passage in the of the whose art was little less than he found plenty of room where none was visible not even the walls with either end of his boat and all without the least apparent effort if anything was needed to make the young american certain he had passed from earth to the magic perfection of these difficult passages under numerous little arched bridges he floated and when at last he emerged upon the grand canal he uttered the word he had heard and was immediately rowed again into a succession of the minor ones finally the march of the early morning began to have its effect in various ways through windows women could be seen preparing other came toward the from which passengers might be expected market boats loaded high with the brightest

him every wind is fretted by his voice almost every and branch feels the sting of his sharp feet how much the growth of the trees is stimulated by this means it is not easy to learn but his action in their seeds is more nature has made him master and committed most of her crops to his the probably over fifty per cent of all the on the are cut off and handled by the alone and of those of the big trees perhaps ninety per cent pass through his hands the greater portion is of course stored away for food to last during the winter and spring but some of them are tucked separately into loosely covered holes where some of the seeds and become trees but the is only one of the many provinces over which he holds sway for his dominion extends over all the belt of the coast mountains and far northward throughout the majestic forests of washington and british i make haste to mention these facts to show upon how substantial a foundation the importance i to him rests the is closely allied to the red or of the eastern woods ours may be a of this species distributed westward to the pacific by way of the great lakes and the rocky mountains and thence southward along our this view is suggested by the fact that our species becomes and more like in general the farther it is traced back along the course indicated above but whatever their relationship and the forces that have acted upon them the is now the larger and more beautiful animal from the nose to the root of the tail he measures about eight inches and his tail which he so uses in his feelings is about six inches in length he wears dark gray over the back and half way down the sides bright the mountains of on the belly with a of dark gray nearly black separating the upper and under colors this dividing however is not very sharply defined he has long black whiskers which gives him a rather fierce look when observed closely strong claws sharp as fish hooks and the brightest of bright eyes full of telling speculation a king s river indian told me that they call him which rapidly pronounced with the first syllable heavily is not unlike the exclamation he on his way up a tree when excited most in call him the pine and when i asked an old whether he knew our little he replied with brightening countenance oh yes of course i know him everybody knows him when i to in the woods i often find out where the deer are by his at em i call em because they re so mighty quick and all the true are more or less in speech and movements but the is so possessing as he does every attribute peculiarly concentrated he is the of flashing from branch to branch of his favorite crisp and glossy and as a give him wings and he would any bird in the woods his big gray cousin is a animal seemingly light enough to float on the wind yet when leaping from limb to limb or out of one to another he sometimes to gather strength as if making efforts concerning the up the shot of which he does not always feel exactly confident but the with his body leaps and in hidden strength seemingly as independent of common muscles as a mountain stream he threads the branches of the pines stirring their needles like a rustling breeze now shooting across in lines now in curves from side to side in sudden and in giddy and around the trunks getting into what seem to be the most impossible situations without sense of danger now on his now on his head yet ever graceful and his most irrepressible of energy with little and of perfect repose he is without exception the wildest animal i ever saw â a fiery little bolt of life in quick and the woods best one can hardly think of such a creature being dependent like the rest of us on climate and food but after all it requires no long acquaintance to learn he is human for he works for a living his time is in the indian summer then he and like a farmer working every day for hours saying not a word cutting off the ripe at the top of his speed as if employed by the job and examining every branch in regular order as if careful that not one should escape him then descending he stores them away beneath logs and in anticipation of the hunger days of winter he seems himself a kind of fruit â both fruit and flower the of the pines every the mountains of pore of his body and eating his flesh is like one never of this bright of nature â this brave little voice crying in the wilderness â of observing his many works and ways and listening to his curious language his musical gossip is as to the ear as to the and though he has not exactly the gift of song some of his notes are as sweet as those of a â almost like in softness while others and like he is the mocking bird of pouring forth mixed chatter and song like a fountain barking like a dog screaming like a hawk like a or a while in bluff audacious he is a very in descending the trunk of a tree with the intention of on the ground he preserves a cautious silence perhaps of and but while rocking safely at home in the pine tops there is no end to his and noise and woe to the gray or that to set foot on his favorite tree no matter how they trace the of the bark they are speedily discovered and kicked down stairs ,13
